<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/divider.jpg" alt="decorative line"></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mountains</span> are the homes of giants,—giants in
brawn and giants in brain. The giants of brawn may
be the more numerous, and in the sense of muscle
and fisticuffs, more powerful; but not in the sense
of manhood and power that achieves results that are
far-reaching and that endure,—results that thrill a
nation’s heart and command the admiration of the
world.</p>

<p>Whoever makes you proud that you are a man,—that
you are an American citizen,—makes you
feel that life is not only worth living, but that to
live is joy and glory,—such an one lifts you up
toward those higher regions from which man has
evidently fallen, and gives some glimmer and hint
of the old image and likeness in which we were
created. That man who comes from nearest to the
nation’s heart and gets nearest to the world’s heart,
brings with him lessons of wisdom, goodness, and love
which shall work like leaven with transforming power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>Great not only in brains, but great in heart, also,
are the giant men of true greatness, who come down
from the mountains into the arena of the world’s
activities. They need no introduction. The world
awaits them, recognizes, and hails them. They know
and are known; they love and are beloved. Place
awaits them, and they enter; fitness fits; life is a
triumph, and they are happy. Such men, fresh from
nature’s mint, bring consciences with them,—consciences
unseared, into the battle of life.</p>

<p>These are not only the germ of character and the
source of joy, but chief among the elements of that
stupendous strength which makes victory their birthright,
and victory is the birthright of every good,
true soul that will work to win. Only the false and
the indolent are sure to fail; the true and industrious
are ever succeeding.</p>

<p>Especially great in powers of will are the men who
come forth from the nation’s strength and give themselves
back in exalted service to a nation’s life. The
great streams that flow into the ocean, went forth
of the ocean in mists and clouds of rain. The
great men of Rome were the products of Rome. The
great men of Germany and France are the products
of those respective countries. And so the great men of
America are the products of America. It took generations
to produce the heroes of the Revolution,
but when the hour struck, they came forth, full armed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
with a purpose that blood could not weaken, clad in
a panoply that no host could destroy. Washington
blazed forth as an orb of greater magnitude in the
chair of state, in time of peace, than in the saddle
in time of war. As a warrior he cut out the work,
as statesman he made it. Statesmanship is more the
work of the whole man and of a life-time. Garfield was
splendid upon the field of battle, but while there he
shone as a star among suns, while in the halls of
state he shone as a sun among stars. There was a
steady grandeur of purpose, a magnificence of character,
a wealth of intellect, a power of thought, a
loftiness of courage, of that high, heroic type which
moral stamina alone can produce, which created a
greater demand for him in the councils of the nation
than in the battle-front when warriors were the nation’s
sorest need. Others could take his place in
Tennessee, but not in Washington.</p>

<p>Among the nation’s great productions, born midway
between the war of the Revolution and the war of
the Rebellion; born in times of peace, for times of
direst carnage and divinest peace again, a very prince
of the land; born to lead, and born to rule; springing
at once with the bound of youthful blood into
the foremost ranks of the nation’s monarchs of forces,
and emperors of kingly powers, is he who leads to-day
the giant forces of the great nation’s conquering
host, the Hon. <span class="smcap">James G. Blaine</span>, not of Maine, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
of Massachusetts; not of Minnesota, or the Golden
Gate, but of America. He is a man of the nation’s
heart, a man of the nation’s brain, a man of conscience,
and a man of will; large, vivid, and powerful
in his consciousness, wherein he realizes, in most
brilliant conceptions, both the power and glory of
men and things. He came forth from the mountains
of the Alleghanies, a giant from the nation’s side.</p>

<p>Never since the nation’s youth was there such demand
for any man. He is emphatically the typical
American, and the yeomanry would have him. They
caught his spirit, and would not shake off the spell
of his genius. They forget not to-day that he was
Garfield’s first choice, and sat at Garfield’s right hand.
They remember, as only they who think with the
heart can remember, that as his pride and confidant,
he was by Garfield’s side in that awful hour of holy
martyrdom, thrusting back the terrible assassin with
one hand, and with the other catching the falling
chief. Garfield knew him, Garfield loved him, Garfield
sanctioned, honored, trusted, and exalted him. And
the sentiments of that great heart which beat out its
life-blood for the nation’s glory then, it is firmly believed,
are the sentiments of the nation’s heart to-day.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">“O</span>LD Hickory is coming! He will
be along in his great coach to-morrow,
before noon,” rang out the cheery
voice of Uncle Will Blaine, who
seemed glad all over at the prospect of once
more seeing the Hero of New Orleans and the
man of iron will.</p>

<p>“Well, let him come,” said the Prothonotary.
“I would not walk up to the cross-roads to see
him,” and the face of the old Whig grew stern
with determination.</p>

<p>“You will let me take Jimmy, will you not,
to see the old General?”</p>

<p>“O, yes, you can take him,” the politic use
of General instead of President having relaxed,
somewhat, the stern features of the sturdy
Scottish face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“He’s coming! He’s coming! Hurrah! Hurrah!
Here he comes,” shouted voice after voice
of the great crowd assembled on the morrow,
from valley and mountain, Uncle Will leading
off at last, with the regular old-fashioned continental
“Hip, Hip, Hurrah,” with three-times-three.</p>

<p>Martial music, of the old revolutionary sort,
rang out, with fife and drum, as President Jackson,
who had just been succeeded by Martin
Van Buren, after serving from 1829 to 1837,
stepped from his carriage, and after a hearty
greeting, spoke a few incisive words, as only the
old hero could.</p>

<p>A boy seven years old was held above the
crowd, just before him, by the strong arms of
Uncle Will. The General saw the large, wondering
eyes, and the eager face, patted him
on the head, saying, “I am glad to see you,
my noble lad.”</p>

<p>The boy was James G. Blaine.</p>

<p>The impression of that moment remains to
this hour. Little did General Jackson think he
was looking into the face of a future candidate
for the presidency.</p>

<p>The National Road over which the congressmen
and presidents, and the great tide of travel
from the west and south, passed to and from
Washington, was near his father’s door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>This National highway, built by the government
before the days of railroads and steam-boats,
was a strong band of union between remote
sections of the country. It was a highway
of commerce as well as of travel, and
formed one of the chief features in the country,
so rapidly filling up after the fearful storms of
war were over and the settled years of peace
had come.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, that inspired penmen
have sketched the infancy of most of the great
men whose lives they have portrayed. This is
beautifully true of Moses, the great emancipator
and leader, a law-giver of the ancient Hebrew
people. How they glorify the childhood of this
great man, and make us love him at the start!
So, also, are the infancy and childhood of Samuel,
great among the prophets of Israel, disclosed.
The voice of his heroic mother is heard as
she gives him to the Lord. The infancy of
John, the mighty man at the Jordan, and of
Jesus, are most impressively revealed. No lovelier
pictures hang on the walls of memory; no
sweeter sunshine fills the home than the little
ones with their joy and prattle, and with the
sublime possibilities to be unfolded as they fill
up the ranks in humanity’s march, or take the
lead of the myriad host.</p>

<p>As we go back to study the beginnings of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
world, so may we well look back to behold the
dawning of that life, great in the nation’s love
and purpose to-day.</p>

<p>We shall find there a child of nature, born
in no mansion or city, but on “Indian farm,”
upon the Washington side of the Monongahela
River, opposite the village of Brownsville, and
about sixty miles below Pittsburgh, in the old
Quaker State of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>It was at the foot-hills of the Alleghanies, a
region wild, romantic, and grand, well fitted to
photograph omnipotence upon the fresh young
mind, and impress it with the greatness of the
world. It was a section of country whose early
history is marked with all that is thrilling in
the details of Indian warfare, which constituted
the chief staple of childhood stories.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone and the Wetzells had been there.
The startled air had echoed with the crack of
their rifles; the artillery of the nation had resounded
through these mountains; the black
clouds of war had blown across the skies, and the
smoke of battle had drifted down those valleys.</p>

<p>All that is terrible in nature had its birth and
home in that section of our country, which is
most like the great ocean petrified in its angriest
mood and mightiest upheavals. The bears and
wolves, in their numbers, ferocity, and might commanded
in early days the respect even of savages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
while elk and deer, antelope and fowl, and
fish in endless variety, birds and flowers of every
hue, and foliage of countless species, won the admiration
of these rude children of nature.</p>

<p>Here in this Scotland of America, born of a
sturdy ancestry whose muscle and brain, courage
and mighty wills, had made them masters of
mountain and glen,—here in the heart of the continent,—James
G. Blaine was born. Eternal vigilance
had not only been the price of liberty in
that bold mountain home for generations, but the
price of life itself.</p>

<p>It was in a large stone house, built by his
great-grandfather Gillespie, that James Gillespie
Blaine was born, January 31, 1830, one of eight
strong, robust, and hearty children, five of whom
survive. It was midway between the war of 1812
and the Mexican war of 1848, and in a country
settled nearly fifty years before by soldiers of the
Revolution. Few are born in circumstances of
better promise for the full unfolding of the faculties
of body and mind than was this child of four
and fifty years ago, cradled in the old stone house
on the ancestral farm. The house itself tells
of the Old World; and those mountains whose
heights are in the blue, tell of Scottish and Irish
clans that never lose the old fire and the old love,
and that marched from the conquest of the Old
to the conquering of the New World.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>The father, Ephraim Lyon Blaine, was of Scottish
origin, and Presbyterian of truest blood, with
sign and seal and signet stamp of the old Scotch
Covenanters upon life and character. His ancestors
came to this country in 1720,—one hundred
and ten years before the birth of James.</p>

<p>His mother, Maria Gillespie, was of an Irish-Catholic
family from Donegal in Ireland. They
belonged to the Clan Campbell, Scotch-Irish Catholics,
and descended from the Argyles of Scotland.
They came to America in 1764, and were Catholics
through and through. They were large land-owners
in America, and resided wholly in old
colonial Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The great-grandfather of Ephraim Lyon Blaine,
father of James G., was born in 1741, and died
at Carlisle, Penn., in March, 1804. He was a
colonel in the Revolutionary war from its commencement,
and the last four years of the war
was the Commissary General. He was with Washington
amid the most trying scenes, and enjoyed
his entire confidence. During the dark winter at
Valley Forge, he was by the side of the Commander-in-Chief,
and it is a matter of history that
the army was saved from starvation by his vigilant
and tireless activity. It is not difficult to see
how stupendous was the task of subsisting broken
and shattered forces in the dead of an awful
winter, upon an exhausted country. It required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
skill and courage, tact and force of personal
power, not surpassed even in the daring march of
Napoleon across the Alps. But he did it, brave,
determined spirit that he was. Others might falter,
but not he; others might break down from
sheer exhaustion or dismay, but not General
Blaine, so long as the fires of the unbroken spirit
of the old Covenanters heated the furnace of his
heart, and their high resolve for liberty was enthroned
in his affections.</p>

<p>From such parent stock what shall the bloom
and blossom be? What the fruitage and harvesting
of other years from the seed-sowing of such
splendid living? Not what the height of stature,
but what the stature of soul,—not what the
breadth of back, nor bigness of brawn, but what
the breadth of mind and bigness of brain?</p>

<p>Let the history of our day and generation make
reply.</p>

<p>Eight years before the old patriot General
died, at Carlisle, his grandson, Ephraim Lyon
Blaine, the father of James, was born in the
same quaint old Scottish town. At Dickinson
College he received his education, and settled as
a lawyer in Washington County, Penn., where
for years he lived an honored and useful life as
Prothonotary of the Courts; and here, amid the
lull in the storm of battle-years, the boy, James
G. Blaine, was born.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>His cradle-songs were the old songs of the
New Republic. It is pleasant to think of such
a personage coming to consciousness, clear and
strong, among such hallowed scenes of a land
redeemed, a nation born, a people free. All
about our youthful hero were the scarred faces
and shattered forms of those who had come back
from the fields of strife.</p>

<p>The stories of Monmouth and Brandywine, of
Concord and Lexington, of New Orleans and
Yorktown, were lived over and dreamed
about. Living epistles, walking histories, were
all about him. Instead of reading about them,
they read to him, poured out the dearly-bought
treasures of a life, painted scenes that were forever
impressed upon their minds; with all
the shades of life and death, unrolled the panorama
of the great campaigns, through those
long, dread battle-years. What education this, in
home and street, in shop and store, on farm
and everywhere, for patriot youth! It gave a
love and zest for historic reading, which must be
traced when we enter more largely upon his
literary and educational career.</p>

<p>At five years of age the systematic work of
an education began by sending James to
a common country school near by. The old
United States spelling-book was the chief textbook.
Webster’s spelling-book was not then in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
vogue. Nothing remarkable transpired, except to
note the proficiency and steady progress he made
in mastering the language he has learned so
well to use.</p>

<p>The intensity of his life was that within, rather
than the outer life. He was observing, drinking
in with eyes and ears. Robinson Crusoe
was his first book, as it has been with many
another boy, and from this beginning he became
a most omnivorous reader.</p>

<p>His first two teachers were ladies, and are
still living. The first, a Quakeress, Miss Mary
Ann Graves, now Mrs. Johnson, living near Canton,
Ohio, eighty-four years of age; the other
was Mrs. Matilda Dorsey, still living at Brownsville,
just across the Monongahela River from
Washington County, where Mr. Blaine was born.
While speaking in Ohio, five years ago, during
Governor Foster’s campaign, his old teacher,
Mrs. Johnson, came forward at the close of his
speech to congratulate her old scholar. How
little these two women dreamed of the splendid
future of the young mind they helped start up
the hill of knowledge; how little they thought
of the tremendous power with which he would
one day use the words, great and small, he
spelled out of that old book; the great occasions
upon which he would marshal them, as a
general marshals his men for effective warfare;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
of the great speeches, orations, debates, papers,
pamphlets, and books into which he would put
a power of thought that would move nations.</p>

<p>It was merely a country school-house, and the
old frame-building has been torn down, and a new
and more modern brick house substituted. It was
not simply to spell words, but also to read and
write, and, indeed, gain the rudiments of a thorough
English education.</p>

<p>As a learner, he exhibited the same quick,
energetic traits of mind he has since shown in
the use of the knowledge gained.</p>

<p>It was upon the hardest kind of high, rough
seats his first lessons were learned, with none of
the splendid appliances of the graded school of
to-day. Then was the time of the rod and
fool’s cap, which many remember so distinctly.
Boys that fought were compelled to “cut jackets,”
as it was called. The stoutest boy in
school was sent with an old-fashioned jack-knife
to cut three long switches, stiff, and strong, and
lithe. The offending boys were called upon the
floor before the whole school, and each one
given a rod, while the teacher reserved the
third. They were commanded to go at it, and
at it they went, to the uproarious delight of the
whole school. Nothing could be more ludicrous,
as stroke after stroke thicker and faster fell,
on shoulders, back, and legs, while the blood flew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
through their veins hot and tingling. The contest
ended only when the switches gave out.
When one was broken and cast away, the teacher
stepped up and laid his switch on the back of
the boy whose switch was whole, while the other
fellow had to stand and take it from the boy
whose switch was yet sound. So they kept at
it, stroke after stroke.</p>

<p>The demoralizing effect for the moment had a
great moralizing power afterward. No boy ever
wanted to take the place of one of these boys.</p>

<p>Master James was seldom punished at school,
except to have his knuckles rapped with the ruler,
or ears boxed for some slight offence; but
he never failed to take full notes of the fracas,
when other boys received their just deserts. His
observations have always been very minute, and
his remembrances distinct. Among his earliest
recollections is one in 1834, when he was but four
years of age, the building of a bridge across the
Monongahela River to Brownsville, by the company
that constructed the National Road. His
Uncle Will took him by the hand and led him
out upon the big timbers, between which he
could look down and see the waters below. The
building of this bridge was a great event to the
people, and one of special interest in the Gillespie
family, as his grandfather owned the ferry,
which of course the bridge superseded, and which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
had been a source of revenue to the extent of
five thousand dollars a year to him. But in the
march of progress ferries give way to bridges, as
boyhood does to manhood, and by a sort of mute
prophecy that bridge made and proclaimed the
way to Washington more easy. It was to him
the bridge over that dark river of oblivion from
the unknown of childhood to the consciousness
of youth and manhood. This same uncle, William
L. Gillespie, who held him by the hand while on
the bridge, was often with his favorite nephew,
and exerted a strong influence for good upon him.
He was a fine scholar, a splendid gentleman, and
a man of infinite jest. The impressions received
from one so accomplished, and yet so genial, loving,
and tender, during these walks and talks,
of almost constant and daily intercourse, are seen
and felt to-day in the character of the nephew
of whom we write.</p>

<p>The first outbreak in the nature of young James,
and which shows latent barbarism so common to
human nature, was a little escapade which happened
when about five years old. A Welshman,
by the name of Stephen Westley, was digging a
well in the neighborhood; in some way he had
injured the boy and greatly enraged him. The
man at the top of the well had gone away,
and Master James, who never failed to see an
opportunity, or to estimate it at its proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
value and improve it promptly, stepped upon the
scene.</p>

<p>He found his man just where he wanted him,
and without reflection as to consequences, began
immediately to throw clods and stones upon him,
which of course was no source of amusement to
the man below. He screamed lustily, and on
being rescued went to the house and complained
of the young offender, saying,—</p>

<p>“He has too much <i>spurt</i>” (spirit).</p>

<p>It cost James a good thrashing, but the Welshman
is not the only one who has had just cause
to feel that “<i>he had too much spirit</i>.” Indeed it
is the same great, determined spirit, trained, tempered,
and toned by the stern conflict of life,
which is the law of fullest development, and
brought under complete control, that has given
Mr. Blaine his national prominence, and filled the
American mind with the proud dream of his leadership.</p>

<p>His grandfather Gillespie was the great man of
that region. His Indian Hill farm, with its several
large houses and barns, was a prominent
feature of the country. He was a man of large
wealth for his time; built mills and engaged in
various enterprises, damming the river for milling
purposes, which was a herculean task. In 1811,
in company with Capt. Henry Shreve, later of
Shreveport, he sent the first steamer from Pittsburgh.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
It was not until the year following that
Fulton and Livingston began building steamers in
that city.</p>

<p>This grandfather, Neal Gillespie, was five years
old when the war of the Revolution began, and as
a boy received the full impression of those scenes
from the very midst of the fray in his Pennsylvania
home. It doubtless helped to produce and
awaken in him that great energy of character,
and force of personality which enabled him to
amass a fortune in that western wild, and in
every way help forward the country’s development.</p>

<p>It was the good fortune of James to spend the
first nine years of his life in the closest relations
of grandson to grandsire, with this remarkable
man; and doubtless much of that magnetism and
rich personality for which Mr. Blaine is so justly
noted, may be traced to this strong-natured and
powerful ancestor upon the side of his mother,
as well as to Gen. Ephraim Blaine, on the side
of his father. He inherits the combined traits of
character which gave them prominence and success
in life.</p>

<p>The little country school and its slow, monotonous
processes, were not rapid enough for the
swift, eager mind of the boy. He had learned
to read, and a new world opened to him. He
caught its charm and inspiration. He had read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Scott’s Life of Napoleon before he was eight
years old,—a little fellow of seven, on a farm
in an almost wilderness, devouring with his
eager mind such a work! Half of our public
men have never even heard of it yet. But
what is perfectly amazing, before he was nine
years old he had gone over all of Plutarch’s
Lives, reciting the histories to his grandfather
Gillespie, who died when he was nine years of
age.</p>

<p>He acquired all that Isocrates and Alcibiades
tell of, before he was ten years old, and it
is a conviction with Mr. Blaine that the common
ideas of the average boy’s ability need to
be greatly enlarged. Certain it was, that he
inherited a hardy mental and physical constitution.
Life on that great farm kept him engaged
and associated constantly with men who both
enjoyed and appreciated learning, and who loved
him and saw in him at least a remarkably
bright boy.</p>

<p>Especially did his father, who was a college-graduate
and member of the bar, see that he
was steadily and persistently drilled, and to his
father Mr. Blaine freely gives the credit so
largely and justly due. His reading was not
the careless, hap-hazard doing of a big-brained
boy, who read from curiosity simply to while
away time, but there was method in it,—a quieting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
hand was on him,—it was all done under
intelligent, wise, and loving direction.</p>

<p>There was none of the hard, rough, and bitter
experiences in his boyhood days or early manhood,
to which so many of our nation’s great
men were subjected. He had none of the long
and desperate struggle with poverty and adversity
which hung on Mr. Garfield’s early years.
He knew nothing by experience of the privations
and hardships through which Mr. Lincoln
came to the high honors of the nation and the
world; but sprang from the second generation
after the Revolutionary War, and from a long
line of ancestors who had been large land-owners
and gentlemen in the sense of wealth and education,
as well as in that finely cultivated sense,
of which Mr. Blaine is himself so excellent an
exponent.</p>

<p>James worked on the farm, carried water to
the men, and carried the sheaves of grain
together for the shockers, and did just as any
school-boy on a farm would do;—hunt the eggs,
frolic with the calves, feed the pigs, drive up
the cows, run on errands, pet the lambs, bring
in wood, and split the kindlings. He loved the
sports in which boys still delight; went fishing,
played ball, rowed his boat on the river, and
would laugh, and jump, and tumble, and run
equal to any boy. All the boys about him were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
sons or grandsons of old Revolutionary soldiers.
They had a lesson which this day does not enjoy,
to talk over and keep full of the old theme. The
nation was then young, and new, and fresh.
The Fourth of July was celebrated as it is
not now; when old soldiers passed away, their
deeds and worth were all talked over. The
result was an intense Americanism, for which he
has since become noted, and which has made
him an American through and through, of the
most pronounced loyalty and patriotic type, as
to deem a stain upon his country’s honor an
individual disgrace.</p>

<p>Empty sleeves and nothing to fill them, limbs
gone and no substitute for them, were as common
then comparatively as they are now, only
now there is an artificial substitute.</p>

<p>James enjoyed the benefits and blessings of a
large family home. It was the practice of his
father to read aloud to his family, and thus the
evening-hours were utilized in the early education
of his children. Home training, so often neglected
now, was in vogue then, and the legal, scholarly
mind of Mr. Blaine could well choose in his fatherly
love and pride, just what was best suited to
the young minds about him, while he was amply
competent to give intelligent and suitable answers
to the numerous questions called forth by the narration
in hand. That great National Road to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
cities of the Union, and its larger towns, was a
highway of intelligence. Not only did it bring the
mail and all the news, but many a book, magazine,
or other periodical they were pleased to
order.</p>

<p>Beside, the direct communication by steamer
with Pittsburgh and points above, which had been
the case eighteen years before the birth of James,
supplied abundant means for travel and correspondence
with other quarters. Living where the
steamers passed the highway, they were more
highly favored with facilities of commerce and the
news than perhaps any other portion of the land.
They could get all there was going. There was
no telegraph, and none of the swifter means of
travel so common now; canal-boats were a luxury
then. But all was life and energy. The enthusiasm
of manhood was on the nation. Then, indeed,
it was in manhood’s glory. It had grown to
be its own ruler and governor; was truly of age,
and did its own voting. British interference had
learned its lesson of modest withdrawal, and for
the same period of eighteen years no unnaturalized
Englishman had been found on American soil with
a uniform on and a gun in his hand.</p>

<p>There was a fine piano in the home of Mr.
Blaine, and the good wife and mother was an
excellent player, and frequently delighted the
household with music. Songs abounded; a harpsichord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
was in the home, and it added its quaint
music to the melody of the circle.</p>

<p>But James could not leave books alone, especially
history. The history of the country was read by
him over and over again. The books he had read,
and that had been carefully read to him by the
time he was ten years of age, would surpass in
number, size, and literary value, the libraries of
many a professional man, outside his purely professional
works, and not only had the principal
ones been read, but studied and recited. Seldom
is any boy so highly favored with the interested
personal efforts of such a trio of educators as
were the father, uncle, and grandfather of Mr.
Blaine.</p>

<p>It is frequently said by college-graduates, that
they learn more outside of the recitation-room, from
association with teachers and students from libraries
and in the societies, than in the room for
instruction. It was in associating with these relatives,
cultured and gentlemanly, able and instructive,
that he was encouraged and inspired to his
task of learning. James mastered the spelling-book;
in fact, he was the best speller in the
school, and was called out far and near to spelling-matches,
and every time “that boy of Mr.
Blaine’s” would stand alone and at the head,
when all the neighborhood of schools was
“spelled down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>One night the word was “Enfeoff.” It came
toward the last, and was one of the test words.
The sides were badly thinned as “independency,
chamois, circumnavigation,” and a host of other
difficult words had been given out. But the hour
was growing late; some of the young fellows
began to think of going home with the girls, of
a big sleigh-ride down the mountain and through
the valleys, and one big, merry load belonged
over the river at Brownsville, and they began to
be a little restless. But still there was good
interest as this favorite triumphed, and that one
went down. Finally the word was given, all
missed it and sat down but James. Every eye
was on him as the president of the evening
said “Next,” and our little master of the situation
spelt “En-feoff.”</p>

<p>No effort was made to restrain the cheers.
The triumph was complete.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">A</span>T the death of his grandfather Gillespie,
who was worth about one hundred
thousand dollars,—a large sum for
that early time,—Mrs. Blaine inherited,
among other things, one-third of the great
Indian Hill Farm, comprising about five hundred
acres, with great houses, orchards, and barns,—a
small village of itself.</p>

<p>This, with his father’s office in the courts,
and other property, placed the family in good
circumstances, and it was decided to give James
a thorough education. He was now nine years
old, with a mind as fully trained and richly
stored as could be found for one of his years.
He was a ready talker, and loved discussion,
and so frequently showed what there was in him
by the lively debates and conversations into which
he was drawn.</p>

<p>Thus his ability to express himself tersely and
to the point, was early developed. He came to
be, almost unconsciously, growing up as he did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
among them, the admiration and delight of the
large circle of friends and loved ones, whose interest
centered on and about the farm, as well
as among neighbors and acquaintances.</p>

<p>Bullion’s Latin Grammar was called into requisition,
and mastered so well that he can conjugate
Latin verbs as readily now as can his sons
who are recent graduates, the one of Yale, and
the other of Harvard.</p>

<p>The thoroughness with which he did his work
is a delightful feature of his career. One is not
compelled to feel that here is sham, and there
is shoddy; that this is sheer pretense, and that
is bold assumption, or a threadbare piece of
flimsy patch-work.</p>

<p>One word expresses the history of the man,
and that one word is <i>mastery</i>. It fits the man.
Mastery of self; mastery of books; mastery of
men; mastery of subjects and of the situation;
mastery of principles and details. He goes to
the top, every time and everywhere, sooner or
later. And it is largely because he has been to
the bottom first, and mastered the rudiments,
one and all, and then risen to the heights, not
by a single bound, but “climbing the ladder,
round by round.”</p>

<p>The amazing power of dispatch in the man,
as well as thoroughness, are only the larger development
of his youthful habit and character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>It was not so much an infinite curiosity as
an infinite love of knowledge that made his
young mind drink so deeply. His was a thirsty
soul, and only by drinking deeply and long
could the demand be met.</p>

<p>When ten years old, the great campaign of
General Harrison came on. He was ready for
it, and soon filled up with the subject. His impulsiveness
was powerful and intelligent, vastly
beyond his years.</p>

<p>Few men were fresher or fuller of the history of
the colonies and states than this boy. He was,
in fact, a little library on foot, filled with incidents,
names, and dates, familiar with the exploits
of a thousand men and a score of battles,
posted as to the great enterprises and measures
of the day, by reason of his distinguished relations
and his abundant facilities and sources of
information. Perhaps, too, no campaign was ever
more intense and popular, or entered more into
the heart and home-life of young and old, than
that of “Tippecanoe and Tyler too,” “Log Cabin
and Free Cider.” The great gatherings, barbecues,
and speeches, and multiplied discussions
and talk everywhere in house and street, in
office and shop, would fire any heart that could
ignite, or rouse anyone not lost in lethargy.
James was not troubled that way, but was
always on hand; he would sit in the chimney-corner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
or out on the great porch, while the
old-line Whigs gathered to read, and hear, and
digest aloud the news.</p>

<p>The political world had dawned upon him.
He was in it for sure, and in earnest. His historical
mind was gathering history ripe from
the boughs. It was luscious to his taste. He
was somewhere in every procession that wended
its way with music and banners and mottoes
innumerable to the place of speaking, and absorbed
the whole thing.</p>

<p>Few could have voted more intelligently than
he when election day came, for few had taken
a livelier interest in the whole campaign, or
taken the matter in more completely.</p>

<p>In three years he was admitted to college, so
this was no spurt of mental power, but a steady
growth, and but marked an era of intellectual
unfolding.</p>

<p>It was a genuine and profitable source of most
practical education, for all through the great and
exciting campaign he did nothing else but
attend the monster demonstrations. Dr. William
Elder and Joseph Lawrence, the father of
Hon. George B. Lawrence, now in Congress,
were particularly powerful in impressions upon
him.</p>

<p>Among the prominent speakers going through,
who stopped to address meetings, was Wm. C.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Rivers, of Virginia, who is particularly remembered
by Mr. Blaine.</p>

<p>Hon. Thomas M. T. McKenna, father of the
present Judge McKenna, was a distinguished personage
in that portion of the state, and took an
active and influential part in the contest,—a contest
full of vim, as it was the first Whig victory
on a national scale, but as full of good nature.
Jackson’s severe methods and measures, throttling
the Nullifiers, sweeping out of existence the
great United States Bank at Philadelphia, with
its $150,000,000 of capital, and sundry other measures,
had filled the people with consternation, and
a great change was imperatively demanded.</p>

<p>Newspapers were numerous in the home of Mr.
Blaine, and never escaped the vigilant eye of the
young and growing journalist and statesman. The
Washington <i>Reporter</i> made a large impression upon
him, as did also the old Pittsburgh <i>Gazette</i>, a
semi-weekly paper, and the <i>Tri-weekly National
Intelligencer</i> (Gales and Seaton, editors) was of
the strongest and most vigorous character; also,
the <i>United States Gazette</i> (semi-weekly), published
at Philadelphia, and edited by Joseph R. Chandler,
of that city, and later on Joseph C. Neal’s
<i>Saturday Gazette</i>. Surely the incoming of these
nine or ten papers into the home every week, counting
the semi- and tri-weekly issues, would furnish
mental pabulum of the political sort in sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
quantity to satisfy the longing of any young
mind. No wonder his growth was strong and
hardy. We have heard of an American boy of
ten or twelve, who followed the Tichborne Claim
case at its original trial through the English
courts, but he was a bright high-school boy,
who had every advantage of the best graded
schools, and improved them steadily, and yet it
was greatly to his credit. Graded schools were
unknown in 1840, yet James, who had finished
reciting Plutarch’s Lives the year before to his
Grandfather Gillespie, watched eagerly for the
heavily loaded sheets as they came by post or
steam-boat, and posted himself on their contents.
Besides these numerous papers, two magazines
were taken and steadily read by the boy. They
were both published in Philadelphia,—<i>Graham’s
Magazine</i> and <i>Godey’s Lady’s Book</i>. The one
was dinner, and the other dessert, to the ever
hungry mind.</p>

<p>The magazines will be remembered as among
the very best the country afforded at that time.
But things that do not grow with the country’s
growth are soon outgrown in the day of steam
and lightning.</p>

<p>The boy who read those periodicals then has
not been outgrown, but he has outgrown much
that then caused him to grow. They constituted
the chief part of polite literature, as it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
called, of that form, and helped in the culturing
process which has resulted in harvests so
abundant.</p>

<p>Can we imagine the deep joy and satisfaction
of that mere boy of ten years at the election
of General Harrison, for whom he had cheered
a hundred times? And when he came through on
his way to Washington, to be inaugurated president,
he stayed over night at Brownsville, just
across the bridge over the river, and James was
presented to him.</p>

<p>No camera obscura ever photographed a face
so distinctly, and no curious eyes ever took in
the details of the scene more perfectly.</p>

<p>In addition to the two lady teachers who
bore a part in the early education of James
Blaine, there are four men who held a conspicuous
place as instructors in the neighboring
country school he attended, and who are remembered
with gratitude to-day. These are Albert
G. Booth, Joshua V. Gibbons, Solomon Phillips,
and Campbell Beall. Mr. Booth is still living, and
has doubtless rejoiced many times that he did his
foundation work so well.</p>

<p>Mr. Booth was one of those patient, careful,
devoted workers who do good, honest work.</p>

<p>Joshua V. Gibbons bore a striking likeness to
Abraham Lincoln. When an old man, he visited
Mr. Blaine in Congress, at the time he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Speaker of the House. Mr. Blaine invited him to
a seat beside him, in the Speaker’s desk. It was
a worthy honor to a noble teacher, a moment of
thrilling interest to the great national assembly,
and attracted universal attention.</p>

<p>Mr. Gibbons was a man of heavy, strong mind,
and forceful personality, and made himself deeply
and strongly felt in the progress of young Blaine’s
mental growth. He did solid, accurate, and enduring
work.</p>

<p>Homely people, as a general thing, have quite a
fund of native goodness, a sort of genial love and
sympathy, to atone for physical defects. Such
seemed to be the case with the man who so resembled
Mr. Lincoln, and it drew all hearts to him.
There was no rod or ruler in school so long as
he taught, and no need of any. Such things
are generally used in the school-room or family
to supply deficiencies of wisdom, tact, and genuine
ability. He simply won their love and
respect, and it was their joy to give it. He
taught them, also, things outside of the books,
and told them plenty of good, wholesome stories.
One day, in speaking about the heathen being
away round on the other side of the world, he
simply remarked,—“Of course you know the world
is round,” but of course they did not.</p>

<p>The great eyes of James dilated, but he said
nothing. He could not help thinking and taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
a child’s view of it when school was out. It
did not hurt much to fall down four or five
times as he went home that night, with his eyes
upturned toward the Heavens, and the great
thought revolving in his brain. The first question
his mother heard was,—</p>

<p>“Is this world round, anyhow, and how is it
round?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my child,” and the old story of the
ship was told, and he was examining the picture
in the atlas when his father came in, and
<i>he</i> was sounded and agreed with the assured
fact of science; and that night when he went
up the hill to grandfather’s house to recite Plutarch,
first of all he asked,—</p>

<p>“Grandpa, did you know this world was round?”</p>

<p>Grandpa took him up in his great arms,
and told him all about it, and showing him
through the window the great round haystack,
on whose top and sides there was room for
twenty boys like him without falling off, and how
“the earth keeps turning around and around all
the time, and a great power holds people on,
just as the roots hold the trees, so no one can
fall off,—and the fact is, it is so big, and large,
and round, and wide, they cannot fall off,” Jimmy
thought he saw it and felt that it must be
so.</p>

<p>But the next week when he went to Pittsburgh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
with Uncle Will, on the steamer, he was looking
all the way for proof that the world was round.</p>

<p>But what puzzled the boy fully as much, was
the grave assertion, made without proof, that the
sun does not move, when he knew that it did
rise and set. Grandpa, and his parents, and
Uncle Will, had to hold court every day until
these questions were all settled, the testimony
all in, and the dreams of the young learner
reflected other scenes.</p>

<p>His youth had a great sorrow. No grandson
was ever loved and petted and cared for and
helped in a thousand ways as his Grandfather
Gillespie had helped and loved and cared for
him. Though a man of affairs, and carrying on
business operations on a large scale and in distant
parts, he loved his home and all about
him, and took special pride in this boy. The
heart of James was truly won. It was his special
joy to be up at grandfather’s. It was not the big
red apple-tree, nor the great clock on the stairs,
nor the old rusty sabre and flint-lock musket, and
the many relics of the Revolution that attracted
him, but grandfather himself.</p>

<p>But grandfather did not get up, one morning,
and the doctor was there, and nobody went to
work, and there was general alarm. The delirium
of fever was on him, but his strong constitution
resisted its ravages of inward fire for days and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
weeks. Now he went there oftener, walked more
softly, asked more eagerly. It all seemed so very
strange. There was his great chair vacant, and
the hand that had so often lain on his head
seemed void of touch and power now. Everything
seemed to stop. Books had nothing in
them now; papers were unopened. The world
grew darker and darker, until one black night,
amid a terrific storm, word came that grandfather
had just died, and father and mother
would not be home for some time. The sun
seemed to set to James, and he cried himself
to sleep, while the other children bewailed their
loss.</p>

<p>The morrow was bright and clear, but full of
sadness, and as he looked upon the dear old
man lying there, and felt his cold face and
hand,—he had never seen death before,—he was
filled with wonder. The loss, indeed, was great
to him. But his memory was an inspiration, and
knowing what grandpa would have him do, he
returned to his study with renewed energy and
to feel more than ever the worth and power of
books the departed one had prized so highly.</p>

<p>Solomon Phillips was a Quaker and a farmer,
but a man of strong, powerful intellect, honest
as the day was long, painstaking and persevering.
Mathematics were his special delight. It
is a triumph of skill in teaching to love a hard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
difficult science so as to get others to love it,
also. In this he succeeded. He felt its worth
and power. He would divide 0 by 1 (zero by
one), and get infinity, and sit and gaze out
into its clear, white depths; and reversing the
process he would divide one by zero, and get
the same result, and again gaze upon the white
depths of a world most beautiful to thought, in
its clear, unclouded, not nothingness, but somethingness,
and that something infinity. He
seemed almost to worship at the shrine of this
kingly science, and would tell again and again
how brilliant and beautiful, and with what delightful
accuracy, the labyrinths of the most
gnarled and vexed problems opened to him.</p>

<p>This was the man to give Master James his
great lift in preparation for college.</p>

<p>He followed promptly wherever the Quaker
master led the way. Week after week, and
month after month, and term after term, the
drill went on. There were no bounds or limits
then, as in academies now, so these were
passed as ships pass the equator, or railroad
trains pass state or county lines. Hard study
was the work of the hour, but hard study made
work easy, and this was the secret, of all his
progress,—constant study brought constant victory.</p>

<p>When his Grandfather Gillespie died, his father
took up the drill in history, and Hume’s England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
was gone over carefully, beside Marshall’s
Life of Washington and a volume of Macaulay’s
Essays which he got hold of as a young boy.</p>

<p>His father had a fine, large library, in which
he delved by day and night, and aroused his
son not only by example to constant application,
but also by persistent pressure. Here is
the real key to that early career of youthful
days so thoroughly utilized,—the father’s intelligent
watchfulness, and careful method, and constant
direction. Only gauge the wheel to the
stream, and the grist to the wheel, and there
will be no danger.</p>

<p>The father determined his son should be educated
to the utmost, and planned and wrought
accordingly. No time was lost, and no undue
haste made; it was the persistency of constant
pressure that won the day.</p>

<p>His boyhood was a happy, healthy period.
He could swim across to Brownsville, discarding
both ferry and bridge.</p>

<p>He went nutting with the boys, as is their
wont when autumn days are on the woods, and
Nature, glorified with a thousand tints of foliage,
is, in the poet’s sombre language, “in the sere
and yellow leaf.” Black walnuts, butternuts,
shellbarks, hickory nuts, and chestnuts rewarded
their search, and gladdened winter evenings with
their cheer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>There was nothing unnatural about young
Blaine. He was no prodigy; no marvel, except
of industry and constant training. He was simply
a fair exhibition of what a good average boy,
well endowed with pluck and brains may become
in the hands of good teachers, and under
the guidance of intelligent love and the unyielding
pressure of a strong paternal will. What
his Eulogy says of Garfield is equally true of
himself:—“He came of good stock on both
sides;—none better, none braver, none truer.
There was in it an inheritance of courage, of
manhood, and of imperishable love of liberty, of
undying adherence to principle.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine could also speak of himself as
“fifth in descent from those who would not endure
the oppression of the Stuarts,” and had
fought under Prince Charles in the affair of
1715 and 1723.</p>

<p>So satisfactory had been his progress thus far
in the school, that the plan of his education involved,
in 1841, sending him to Lancaster, Ohio,
where for one term he was in a school taught by
a younger brother of Lord Lyons, so long our
Minister from England, who according to English
law inherited nothing from his father’s estates, the
eldest brother receiving all; and so he made his
home in the New World, and worthily engaged in
training future presidents of the great Republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>During his term in Lancaster his home was
in the family of Hon. Thos. Ewing, his mother’s
cousin. Mr. Ewing was a United States Senator
when James was born, and entered the Cabinet of
President Harrison the year before James’s appearance
there as student, as Secretary of the
Treasury, and in 1849 in Taylor’s Cabinet as
Secretary of the Interior, both of whom died
soon after their inauguration. In 1849 Governor
Ford appointed him to the Senate in the place
of Hon. Thomas Corwin, who entered Fillmore’s
Cabinet.</p>

<p>This first and only term of school away from
home and out of that little country school-house
in preparation for college, under the broadening
influences of such a home and the inspiration
of such a teacher, was a long stride forward
toward the desired goal. It was a great journey
in those days for a boy only eleven years old to
make, but it added another large chapter to his
already wide range of knowledge and experience.</p>

<p>The other James, only a year younger, was
living with his mother in the woods of Orange,
in the same state of Ohio, improving the modest
privileges of school, and maturing slowly,
the winter James G. Blaine spent at Lancaster
in the spacious home of that distant relative
who had enjoyed all the high honors of the
government, next to the presidency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>These boys were probably not over one hundred
miles apart that winter, and both at school,—investing
more largely in themselves than in
all besides, using themselves as capital, their
own powers and endowments. Surely no course
is wiser, as their careers amply prove. It is
gathering what is outside that one may get out
what is inside, that is the process of education;
not getting what is outside regardless of what
is within, that may be developed into treasures
of transcendent worth, more valuable than the
contents of forest and mine.</p>

<p>American history furnishes few examples of
the practical value of cultivated brain more
illustrious and potent than James A. Garfield
and James G. Blaine, and each the opposite
in temperament and opportunity, but both
brought up on a farm, and both getting their
first start up the hill of knowledge in a country
school.</p>

<p>Where are the two boys who, forty or fifty
years from now, will take the helm of state
and guide the ponderous ship farther on her
tireless voyage?</p>

<p>No ever-recurring problem for the nation’s
wisdom and the nation’s choice, is greater than
this one problem of presidents. It is the nation’s
offer of greatness and renown to any boy
who, through long years of patient and persistent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
endeavor, will seek full and honorable preparation
for the prize she proffers.</p>

<p>The brief stay at Lancaster was soon over,
and James once more harnessed into the old
régime at home, with Campbell Beall for teacher,
in the same old house that seven years before
he entered, a boy of five years old.</p>

<p>In one year he is to pass his examination to
enter Washington and Jefferson College, in the
village of Washington, their shire-town of three
thousand inhabitants, twenty-four miles away.
Will he be ready? Much depends on Campbell
Beall, much on his father, and much on himself.</p>

<p>The common English branches are well wrought
over, languages and mathematics have come to
be a delight, and in the old atmosphere, and
the old ways, with the old inspiration on him,
progress comes anew. Lines of reading from the
library are kept up; the papers and magazines
are not neglected; political matters are settled;
bad news comes in from every quarter; Tyler
is at the head of affairs; Ewing has sent in
his scathing letter of resignation as Secretary of
the Treasury, charging him with violating every
promise the Whig party made to the people;
but there is no campaign, no voting to be done,
so the thing is settled.</p>

<p>Mr. Beall proves a good teacher. The Latin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
begun at Lancaster is renewed at home, and
so the winter goes by. Time seems literally
to be alive and drifts like the snow as it goes
rushing by. As Benj. F. Taylor has it:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“How the winters are drifting like flakes of snow,</div>
<div class="indent">And the summers, like buds between;</div>
<div class="verse">And the year, in its sheaf, so they come and they go</div>
<div class="verse">On the river’s breast, with its ebb and its flow,</div>
<div class="indent">As it glides thro’ the shadow and sheen.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Father, mother, teacher, Uncle Will, all seem
convinced that James can pass and enter college;
so, though only thirteen years of age, his father
takes him in the carriage, and they drive over
to Washington.</p>

<p>It is a great experience for older heads, but
for one so young, a veritable epoch in his history.</p>

<p>It does not take long to convince the president
that he has drawn a prize, and he is entered
with about forty other bright, smart boys,
for the Freshman class in the autumn. After
three months of vacation, the great work is to
begin in real earnest, and the stuff those boys
are made of is to be thoroughly tried and
tested.</p>

<p>There was none of the hard, rough, and bitter
experience in his boyhood days and early manhood
to which so many of our nation’s great
men were subjected. He had none of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
long and desperate struggles with poverty and
adversity which hung on Mr. Garfield’s early
years. He knew nothing, by experience, of the
privations and hardships through which Mr. Lincoln
came to the high honors of the nation and
the world, but sprang from the second generation
after the Revolutionary war, and from a
long line of ancestors who had been large land-owners
and gentlemen, in the sense of wealth
and education, as well as in that finely cultivated.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE summer of 1843 was bright with
the anticipations of college life to the
eager boy. Manhood seemed dawning
upon him, in all its glory. Since his
examinations, the great Dr. McConaughy had
grasped his hand so kindly and drawn him to his
side; then putting his arm around him had said,
as he brushed the long, light hair from his forehead,—</p>

<p>“You are a brave boy; I am glad to see you
and know you. We shall have a good place ready
for you September third, and I shall be glad to
see you in my home.”</p>

<p>The president of Washington and Jefferson College
could appreciate to the full the fact before
him, that this boy, without the aid of high
school or academy, was more than ready for the
studies and honors of college.</p>

<p>The three months of summer were not lost.
A general review was had, and particular attention
paid to toning him up physically. He would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>plunge into the river and swim to his heart’s
content; dash away on horse-back for a good
ride; go over to Brownsville, where they all did
their trading, on errands, and regularly for the
papers and magazines; go on excursions up and
down the river, and, withal, help in the field,
especially at harvest-time, and fill up regular
hours with his best endeavors at study. So
that he was not rusty and broken in habit,
when September came; and it came very soon.
His going to college was quite an event for the
community. The neighbors took pride in it, for
James was greatly beloved. His exploits with
books were known to all. Teachers had reported
his progress and rejoiced in it.</p>

<p>It took a long while to say all the good-byes,
but early Monday morning he was off, and
soon nicely settled in a good boarding-place, and
when the great bell rang out the beginning of
new school-year, James G. Blaine was in his place
taking in the situation in all its magnitude and
interest.</p>

<p>There were one hundred and seventy-five
scholars present, all boys and young men.
There was a young ladies’ school, or seminary,
in another part of the town, but they were
entirely separated, and boys and girls were not
mingled together, as now in some of our colleges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>James devoted himself strictly to study, and
retired promptly at ten o’clock each night. He
found himself in a large class of bright, energetic
students, full of pranks, jokes, and fun,
but still boys of nerve, and pluck, and ample
brain; boys who had been well fitted for the
task before them, many of them in the preparatory
department of the institution itself, so that
they were familiar with the place, and had
known each other for several years. They were
not long in finding that the new boy, who came
from down near the big bridge, knew about
Greek and Latin grammars, and could read without
difficulty when his turn came.</p>

<p>He did not have the town-boy sort of look
that many of the others had, but his good
manners, and kind, easy ways made them feel
and acknowledge that he was a little gentleman,
anyhow. His mother had never neglected her
boy, and his father, being a professional man,
knew the joy and worth of being a gentleman;
and, if they had done but little, his grandfather
had planted seeds of kindness in him enough
to produce a bountiful harvest. He moulded
and shaped his ways and manners to the clear,
strong model that was never wanting in the
old Scottish clans and seems to remain in the
very blood and very atmosphere of life and
character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>There was nothing brusque or acrid about
him. He took on and wore the air and atmosphere
of the enlightened, quiet, and cultured
home-life in which he was brought up. He was
modest and retiring, there for a purpose, and
devoted to its accomplishment. It was not hard,
distasteful work to him, but a loved and longed-for
opportunity. He had no ills or aches to
nurse, or trouble him. He felt greatly the
absence from home. But he was not off in
Ohio now, only four and twenty miles from old,
familiar Indian Hill farm. But his books absorbed
him; study roused and cheered him;
competition electrified and nerved him. Nothing
would sting him like missing a question, or any
petty failure. But these were few and simple.
He took first rank at once, and held it steadily
to the end.</p>

<p>His life at college was a comparatively quiet
one. He never appeared upon a public exhibition,
although he entered the societies, and took
part in debates, read essays, contributed to the
college paper, and delivered orations.</p>

<p>He was rather retiring in his disposition, and
sought rather to be a worshiper at the shrine of
knowledge, than as is so often the case, be worshiped.</p>

<p>The quiet reticence and reserve referred to
may strike some, owing to their knowledge of
his dashing brilliancy of later years. But as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
surprise, the modest, unobtrusive habit was happily
conducive to study, and served as a guard
against many of the intrusions of a student’s
life. While kind and affable, he was not of the
hail-fellow-well-met order. But he was not a recluse,—no
monk with monkish ways. He was
a student, through and through, and he loved
study; it satisfied him and served his aspirations.</p>

<p>He was a boy no longer; he had come to
himself, to self-consciousness; a consciousness of
his powers, to a recognition of his own personal
identity. Manhood was fast coming on him; he
was out of childhood. It was a new world in
thought to him, and life at college a new world
in fact. He was respected and honored and
trusted now, in a sense different from being
loved and petted and cared for at home. There
was not so much praise, but more power in it.
He was on his own responsibility now, and must
rely largely upon his own resources. Manliness
was the needful quality. It was everywhere in
demand. At study it was the prelude to victory;
in the recitation-room it was the well-poised
harbinger of success, and in association
with others it always won. This was just the
quality that those who loved him had sought to
develop in him, and they had not failed. He
would take hold of the hardest task with a marvelous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
energy of resolve. His will was a strong
feature of his personality. It was an element of
power that served him now. He had reached a
long-sought height and was pushing on.</p>

<p>Good teachers are not long in finding good
scholars in a new class. They look for them
as a miner watches for gold, and prize them as
highly. There was such a teacher in the faculty
at Washington, and to Professor Murray Mr.
Blaine feels a deep and lasting debt of gratitude.</p>

<p>Like all good teachers, he felt the dignity and
power of his profession. He could help the
weakest into strength, and put a window in the
darkest mind by his varied questionings, illustrations,
suggestions, and explanations. He was
quiet, but forceful, genial, but severe if laziness
or wanton disregard showed its hydra head. In
his own peculiar way, by virtue of an immense
personality, he would light up and enthuse a
whole class-room.</p>

<p>The Professor found in young Blaine a pupil
to his mind, and James found in the teacher
just the man of his heart. He learned to love
him. A genuine teacher can incarnate himself
in his pupils, just as Napoleon seemed to reproduce
himself in his armies, firing them with his
spirit, arming them with his purpose, so that
they would move with the solid impetuosity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
his own daring, scaling the Alps, triumphing at
Austerlitz, until they came to look, and breathe,
and act him out long after; but Professor Murray
was training men and citizens of the great
Republic. His was a solemn, sacred work, of
grave responsibility. It was worthy of life and
manhood’s strength and prime, as the great
ideals which burned in the heat of his glowing
life fully assured him.</p>

<p>To sit in such a light, to dwell in such a
presence, was to be lead over the fields of conquest
by the hand of Alexander after he had
conquered the world. No wonder this man is
loved and honored, and his memory cherished
sacredly.</p>

<p>Outside of the regular college course, Mr.
Blaine read through the New Testament in
Greek with him three times. This was a Sunday
Bible-class exercise, and shows how deeply
his mind became imbued with the truths of the
Christian religion, which have since made him
a devoted member of the Congregational Church
in Augusta, Maine.</p>

<p>James was no book-worm in college. He was
a severe, close student. This was his chief
business there. He was on his honor, and loved
his work, and so did it well.</p>

<p>Prof. E. B. Neely, superintendent of schools in
St. Joseph, Mo., an old class-mate, says of him:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“James G. Blaine was always looked up to as
a leader, by his class-mates, being universally
recognized as such. While a close student, he
was genial in his habits, and decidedly popular
with all, being the very reverse of what is
known as a book-worm.”</p>

<p>This is just what those who know him now
have reason to expect was the case, and yet it is
very remarkable, from the fact that he was seventeen
and a half years of age when he graduated,
and in a large class of thirty-three, seventeen
of whom entered the Christian ministry.</p>

<p>At the end he was one of those to divide
the honors of his class, and here again we are indebted
to Professor Neely.</p>

<p>“Third, by reference to my class-book you
will see that at the time he graduated Mr.
Blaine was given the second of the three honors
of the occasion. The first, the Latin salutatory,
was delivered by Jno. C. Hervey, of
Virginia; the second, English salutatory, by
James G. Blaine, of Pennsylvania; and the
third, Greek salutatory, by T. W. Porter, of
Pennsylvania.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Blaine graduated he delivered a
masterly oration, most of which he can speak
to-day, after a lapse of thirty-seven years. The
subject was,—“The Rights and Duties of American
Citizens.” How fitting such a theme for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
such a man, and how admirably it shows his
trend of mind!</p>

<p>During his course at college, in 1844, occurred
the great campaign of Henry Clay. It had
been Mr. Blaine’s privilege to meet Mr. Clay,
and he took the liveliest interest conceivable in
the contest. He was a very positive man, decided
and aggressive, especially in his political
opinions. Of course the great question of the
day was debated in the college-society, and Mr.
Blaine was on hand. He usually was on such
occasions, and had a large part in the discussion.
He was so well read in the history of
the country and of parties, had entered so into
the merits of the campaign of General Harrison,
four years before, that with all his growth
and acquisitions since, he was well qualified to
take his position and maintain it against all who
chose a tilt with him. His was the force of
accumulated strength, the weight of reserved
power. He was so full of his subject, that it
seemed to require no effort to bring out the
facts and figures and formulate the arguments
that demolished his antagonist. He joined, as if
by instinct, the fresh young Whig party of progress
and of power. Clay was their idol, and
this was the hour of his destiny. No young
life was ever given with more ardent devotion
to any cause than did the young collegian give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
heart and thought, sympathy and endeavor, to
the star so surely rising. He lead in the fight
among the boys, and won the day; and wherever
voice or influence could reach, he energized
others with the wholesome truths of political
equity, justice, and common sense that filled his
soul. No wonder his theme on Commencement day
was so near the nation’s life. It was near his heart,
and so his first great triumph was celebrated by
considering, back in those times of the slave-power,
<i>Rights and Duties of American Citizenship</i>.</p>

<p>Washington and Jefferson College was famous
in those days for sending forth great men. It
was a great institution of the times. Indeed,
it was two colleges united. Jefferson College
had been located at Connersburgh, some four
miles distant, and was merged into Washington
College at Washington.</p>

<p>This gave increased advantage in picked teachers,
fuller endowment, larger classes, and better
appliances. To go to such an institution, a
mere boy and a total stranger, and take the
lead and keep it through his entire course,
argues for the mental power and furnishing of
the boy, as well as his other qualities of heart
and character. He led his class in mathematics,
as a fellow-student testifies, and thus showed
the unabated influence of his old Quaker teacher,
Solomon Phillips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>The college-library was a great resort for
him, a sort of second home. Here he could
delve, with no thought of time or weariness. It
was his delight and joy. Books seemed a part
of him; he was seldom without them, and yet
he utilized, by good mental digestion and strong
powers of assimilation, the substance of what
he read. He ranged over a wide field, principally
of English works then, as works of American
authors were comparatively few. Indeed, it
is only within the last quarter of a century the
sneer, “Who reads an American book?” has
ceased to sting. Vacation was his busiest time
with books. He was never empty, but always
full.</p>

<p>But all his study and meditation; all his reading,
thought, and observation; all he had gleaned,
gathered, and garnered from books, teachings, and
associations; all that had come to him from
newspapers, periodicals, travel, great men, found
their fitting and powerful culmination in the
great oration he delivered on Commencement day,
in June, 1847. It was sound and convincing,
patriotic and manly, and would do credit to any
graduate to-day, though twice his age. It was
the key-note of a life-long career, which has
ever since been urging in a most potent way
the rights, and discharging the duties of American
citizenship.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE world opened grandly to young
Blaine at his graduation. His college
course had been a triumph, his reception
home an ovation. The heart of
the great class beat with his; their hopes were
justly high, and high especially for him whom
they had learned to love and honor. His power
to make friends and hold them was remarkable.
Those who knew him best loved him most.</p>

<p>One who knew so much of the world must
see some of it, and as yet he had traveled but
little; but a good rest is taken, and the summer
spent at home. Old, familiar scenes are viewed
through larger eyes. Books are reviewed, fresh
volumes read; the news, home and foreign, is
seized with a new avidity by one whose business
of life is just beginning. As yet, though, he
has not been earning money, he has gained
something he can never lose, and that can never
be stolen or borrowed from him. It is his fortune;
his father’s wise plan has been carried out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
and he is ready for business now. A call comes
for a teacher in Blue Licks Military Academy,
at Georgetown, Kentucky, and he is selected
and recommended by the faculty for the place.
He has never taught an hour. Shall he go?
He knows enough, has good command of himself,
and from careful observation, a fair knowledge
of methods. He believes he can do it, for,
as yet, he has never failed, and has always been
able to make himself understood, whether in
private conversations and discussions, or society
debates in college.</p>

<p>The question is decided. He is to receive a
salary of five hundred dollars a year, while boys
of his age are working for eight and ten dollars
a month. It is a man’s work. He is to start
September first, and he will not be eighteen
years old until January. There is not a hair
on his face. But there is a man within, strong
in manly powers, and rich in stores of knowledge.</p>

<p>He had a fine address, clear and strong of
speech, large lustrous eyes, fine conversational
powers, and in all respects, of good appearance.
His youth was in his favor, since it made his
accomplishments all the more marvelous. He had
been well written up and highly recommended
before going, so that anticipations were high on
both sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>It was harder than ever to say good-bye, especially
for mother and son, but it must be
done. They recalled the time when their ancestors
left native land across the seas, to come to
this country, and were reconciled. His father
and Uncle Will tried the name of Professor on
him before he started, and it seemed to fit,
though at first it startled him. It weighed him
down with the gravity of his position, and drove
the last remnant of pedantry from him. He declined
a tall hat and discarded a cane. He was
simple, genuine, and true, and went for just
what he was worth.</p>

<p>The trip to Pittsburgh, and down the river to
Louisville, and out to Georgetown by public conveyance,
was full of interest to him, because it
was his country he was seeing. A steam-boat
explosion, and talk of an insurrection among the
negroes, made him a little nervous. But the
fact that he was going to the state of Henry
Clay, gave him a sort of home feeling, and
made him feel they were his sort of folks, and
then some of the students were from down that
way, and he had met several of the public men
from Kentucky, besides Mr. Clay.</p>

<p>There happened to be an old Jacksonian Democrat
in the stage-coach, who had been attracted
to the young professor by his manly bearing,
his quiet urbanity, which cost him no effort,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
and especially by his politeness in giving a
lady from the Blue Grass region a back seat,
insisting “that she take it” in a most gentlemanly
manner, while he took a far less comfortable
one, riding backward. This brought him
face to face with a full-blooded Kentuckian of
the old type.</p>

<p>“You are a native of the soil, I take it,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but not of this state.”</p>

<p>“Of what state, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“The Keystone state of Pennsylvania, sir,”
with a suppressed air of pride.</p>

<p>“Indeed, then you are from the North?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Clay has a good many friends up there, has
he not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, a great many.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was an awful whipping he got.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he did not deserve it.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t deserve it?”</p>

<p>“I think not; he is a royal man, and would
have made an excellent president, in my judgment.”</p>

<p>“If he had not been a Whig; that spoils
him. Strange how much good and smartness a
man may have, and not have good sense.”</p>

<p>“But he has good sense, in my judgment, if
you will pardon me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“Young man, slavery is a Divine institution.
That is fixed; the Bible decides that!”</p>

<p>These words were said with great emphasis.</p>

<p>“Then what of the Declaration of Independence;
does that conflict with the Bible? Is
that a Divine institution?”</p>

<p>The man was puzzled, but finally said,—</p>

<p>“Well, the Bible don’t have to agree with
everything.”</p>

<p>James had just finished the study of the Constitution,
of Political Economy, of Moral Science,
was thoroughly posted regarding political parties
and all the great questions of the day, and
slavery had a black, villanous look to him.
Some of the sights he had witnessed had roused
his blood, and taking it altogether he was ready
for quite a campaign.</p>

<p>He had never been placed under any particular
restraint, but had talked right out the best
he knew how, and so followed the person up
who encountered him pretty closely, until the
questions were all answered to their satisfaction,
and a few difficult ones asked to his satisfaction.
But when the identical lady whom he had
favored with a seat, asked right out,—“Would
you marry a nigger?” he seemed lifted from his
moorings all at once, and replied almost instantly,
without inspecting his words,—“No,
ma’am, would you?” A fair amount of indignation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
was in the air, without any perceptible delay,
and sundry epithets, so common in those
days, such as “nigger-lover,” “nigger-stealer,”
and “black abolitionist,” found expression. James’
only apology was,—</p>

<p>“Madame, I only asked you the very respectful
and lady-like question you had so kindly
asked me.”</p>

<p>“I admire your courage and independence of
character, sir,” said a young lady opposite, with
some warmth, who, though rather large, and
with a look of rare intelligence, and a voice of
peculiar sweetness and volume, was evidently
still in her teens,—possibly sweet sixteen, in its
fullest glory.</p>

<p>The driver stopped at the foot of a big hill,
and, as was their privilege, several passengers
got out to walk up the hill. James was among
their number. It was a real relief to be in the
open air.</p>

<p>“Give us your hand, young man,” said a fellow-passenger,
as the stage passed on. “I like
yer pluck; brains is good, but it ain’t much
without pluck. I tell you, you sot the truth
right home that time. You are a right smart
kind of a boy. Do they raise meny sich up in
the old Keystone or Yellowstone—What did
you call it? I reckon that that Missis was
right down put out when you axed her what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
she axed you. But, then, they do say a heap
of jokers don’t like to be joked. But my rule
is, tit-for-tat. I tell you, a little nip and tuck
now and then is a mighty edicating sort of
thing, and I guess you’ve been educated,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p>James shook hands and followed up the conversation
until the top of the hill was reached.</p>

<p>All had a good dinner, and felt better.</p>

<p>It was a simple act of courtesy which the
occasion demanded, to help the young lady of
sixteen, more or less, from the coach, as she was
ready to step out after James had alighted, and
as she thanked him very graciously he could but
offer to escort her to the table, and with rare
good grace she assented.</p>

<p>James had done such things before, and done
them very handsomely, in connection with their
college-exhibitions and socials in the town, to
which he occasionally went.</p>

<p>Kentucky is a great country for quail, and the
colored cook had broiled and buttered them that
day exactly to the taste of an epicurean. They
were simply delicious, and just in season. They
enjoyed them hugely, and chatted with the cheer
and gusto of old friends, mostly speaking of the
glories of the North, in which they perfectly
agreed, and upon their homes. “One touch of
nature makes the whole world kin” may be true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
or not, but that little touch of nature in the
stage-coach had made them kin.</p>

<p>Another fresh brace of the savory quails had
just been placed before them, when the coach
dashed around to the door, and the lusty voice of
the driver crying “All aboard!” resounded through
the hall and open door of the dining-room.</p>

<p>There was no alternative, so without delay
they resumed their old seats, and conversation
was discontinued.</p>

<p>The political status of the company had been
pretty well defined, and James had made two
friends, the names of neither of whom, however,
he had learned.</p>

<p>There was a lull in the conversation, and
James was going over his scheme of study and
recitations for the twentieth time, when at three
o’clock Georgetown was announced. He bade
his two friends good-bye, and expressed the hope
that all would enjoy their journey.</p>

<p>The stage had but just started, when the old
Jacksonian said, “I dunno but the boy is more
n’r half right, anyhow.” The young lady knew
he was, but the lady number one did not know
about it.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s mighty sartin the Declaration is
agin’ Slavery, and the Bible can’t stand up for
both, nohow,” said the man who walked up
the hill with James.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>James was now in his lodgings, and liked the
looks of things. He had just brushed and
dusted up when he heard the tap of a drum,
and looking out he saw a line of cadets forming,
and ascertaining that that was the academy,
he walked over and saw one hundred and fifty
fine-looking young men, handsomely uniformed,
each with a musket, marching to music of fife
and drum. They stood erect and stepped together.
It was a fine sight to him. They went
through the evolutions, marked time, marched,
and countermarched.</p>

<p>The entire faculty were present. He ventured
in, and soon heard a messenger announce that
Mr. Blaine had come, but he had missed him.
He simply said, “I am Mr. Blaine,” and the
Principal grasped his hand with evident delight,
placing his left hand upon his shoulder and
saying, “I am glad to see you, Mr. Blaine,”
and introduced him to the other teachers, and
then turning to the students he said, “Battalion,
permit me to present to you our new professor,
James G. Blaine, of Washington, Pennsylvania;
you will please receive him at present arms”;
instinctively Mr. Blaine removed his hat in recognition
of his reception. “Perhaps you have a
word for the boys,” said the Principal, and the
battalion was brought to a “shoulder arms,” an
“order arms,” and then to a “parade rest,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
when, stepping forward, he said,—“I am glad
to see you, gentlemen, in such fine form and
spirit, and so accomplished at your drill, for I
watched you several moments yonder, unobserved.
We had nothing of this kind where I studied,
but I think it must be a fine thing for you.
I hope you will never be needed in your country’s
service, though it does begin to look a
little as though there might possibly be war
with Mexico. But as I have been nearly two
weeks on my journey, and as we shall have
ample time to get acquainted, I will not detain
you longer.”</p>

<p>Three cheers were proposed for Professor Blaine,
and given with a will. The Professor was the
lion of the hour.</p>

<p>The Principal said, “You will take tea with
me, Professor Blaine?”</p>

<p>“With great pleasure.”</p>

<p>And to the other professors, “You will please
take tea with Professor Blaine, at my house.”</p>

<p>The hour spent in the study with the Principal
was not without a purpose on his part. It confirmed
all that Doctor McConaughy and Professor
Murray had written about him, and afforded certain
knowledge that they had drawn a prize.
By an adroit, yet careless method of conversation,
introducing a general discussion of the textbooks
of the day, with their general contents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
their defects and excellences, the great knowledge
of the new man was made evident, and it
was not restricted to the mere curriculum of
studies.</p>

<p>“Surely,” thought he, “I am in for it now in
earnest,” as he was left alone for a few moments
while his host went down to receive his other
guests.</p>

<p>There was not a soul within three hundred
miles who would think of calling him Jim Blaine,
or Jimmy, nor dare to, if by some strange, unnatural
process it did occur to him.</p>

<p>He was treated, respected, and honored as a
man and a scholar. The world had opened to
him, and he had entered. It was well there
was no show or shoddy about him, and he knew
it. The stamp of the mint was on him, and
he passed at par, with the ring of honest coin.</p>

<p>There is a power in some men to meet any
emergency when it is fairly on them. They rise
with the tide, become a part of the occasion,
and adjust themselves to it with a quiet dignity.
He had this power, and felt it on him now.
As he was going down-stairs to be presented
to the ladies, he said to himself, as he threw
back his hair with a quick, decided toss, “No
politics to-night”; and this prolific subject was
mentally abjured.</p>

<p>They received him as an equal, spoke of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
favorable opinion they all entertained of him,
and the joy his coming had given them.</p>

<p>He thanked them, and spoke of the pleasure
he experienced in coming to a state so great in
the nation’s life.</p>

<p>It was a matter of conscience with Professor
Blaine to know where he was going and where
he had been, so that he had made his own
state as well as that of Ohio where he had
spent the term at school, and the state of
Kentucky, a special study; so that when they were
fairly seated at table, and after repeated questions
had been asked, he fairly eclipsed all his
former attempts at conversation, by the brilliancy
of his historical allusions, extending far back
into colonial days.</p>

<p>He had learned, by his early drill in Plutarch’s
Lives, where a brief biography of a
Roman and a Greek are alternately given, and
then comparisons and contrasts between them introduced,
so to deal with states and individuals.
He had thus dealt with political parties and
their leaders, but not to-night. This method
helped him greatly.</p>

<p>Events, dates, names, places, fell into line and
were marshalled like troops just when the drum
tapped, or the word of command was given.
They all seemed amazed; an hour passed by;
material sufficient for a half-dozen Fourth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
July orations had been given. A veritable panorama
of those three great states, three of the
greatest in the Union, seemed to march before
them in sections and decades.</p>

<p>The members of the faculty, who understood
very well what it was to know and to talk,
had some very complimentary things to say.
He had won them all, so unobtrusive was he,
and entirely at his ease, withal.</p>

<p>Monday morning, at nine o’clock, twenty-eight
young men marched into the school-room and
faced him as their teacher, twelve of them
older than himself. They had taken his measure
when on drill, and felt honored to call him
teacher.</p>

<p>They were from the best families of the
state, were clad in bright uniforms, and sat
erect. Mathematics was the first recitation.
He looked around almost instinctively for Solomon
Phillips or Professor Murray, but they were
not there. He was on the platform, not in the
seats. He must lead off. A list of names had
been furnished him. As he read them over,
calling each name by itself, the scholar came
forward and received a hearty shake of the
hand, and was photographed at once in the
mind of the teacher. This was the work of but
a few minutes, yet it recognized each one of
them, and made them feel acquainted. No other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
teacher had done this, but it was something
they could tell of, write home about, and made
them say,—“He is a fine man; I like him.”</p>

<p>He then told them many things about mathematics
as a science, its power in intellectual
development, and its great value in the practical
business of life; its place in astronomy and engineering,
in naval and military operations, and
the certainty with which it assures the mind.</p>

<p>It was a simple, quiet talk, illustrated in
various ways by references to the book and the
sciences spoken of. He thus drew them nearer
to himself, and removed the dread with which so
many approach the vexed subject of mathematics.
This class was in algebra, on at cube root,
doing pretty solid work. The ground was familiar
to him. Problem after problem had been
performed; the whole class seemed roused to a
new interest, and in stepped the Principal, but
the work went on. Every blackboard was in
use; it was a busy scene; there were no idlers
there.</p>

<p>“Never touch a problem hereafter,” he said,
“unless you are certain you have the rule fixed
in your minds. Do not forget this, and if you
have that clear, then ask yourself, in case of
difficulty, ‘What axiom shall I use next?’ for
you must keep using them, as you do the letters
of the alphabet, over and over again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“One thing more: we are going to have hard,
quick work done in this room, and be sure now
that every one gets ready for it, and we will
have a splendid time.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine’s resources had never been drawn
on before in any real, business-like way. But
it was an experience he was ready for, and he
liked it. He next had a class in Latin, and
then in United States history. He could not
have been better suited in studies. They were
just the ones that delighted him. Christmas
seemed to come that year on wings, and soon
the spring-time was on them, and the picnic
season.</p>

<p>He had shut himself up closely to his work.
Visitors had abounded, but he accepted but few
of the invitations that were given. He did not
even accept any one of several invitations to
spend the holidays with students at their homes.
A short trip to Lexington and Frankfort satisfied,
and he was back at work.</p>

<p>The literature of every subject connected with
his recitations must he read up carefully, and
every spare hour was devoted to these lines of
study.</p>

<p>But he did go to the annual picnic. He
was part of the school, and he must go.
Everybody went, seemingly. It was a sectional
affair; other schools were there. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
met a familiar face: it was a lady’s; who could
it be?</p>

<p>She recognized him, and bowed. He returned
it. He awoke as from a revery, he had so
lived in his work; and being worried with the
question, “Where have I seen that face,” traced
it at once to the stage-coach. They were introduced.</p>

<p>It was Miss Hattie Stanwood, of Augusta,
Maine. She also was teaching school, not far
away. It was quite the thing in that day for
well-educated New England girls or young ladies
to go South and teach school.</p>

<p>They had remembered each other through the
winter, but neither knew the other’s name,
address, or occupation. Now all was clear.
Thoughts and dreams were actualized. It was
a marvel, almost a miracle, that they should
meet.</p>

<p>The picnic had no further charms for them.
They quietly strolled away together over the
hills after the lunch was served, and for three
full hours they lived in each other’s lives. They
seemed strangely near to each other, and a peculiar
peaceful joy seemed living in their hearts.
It had evidently come to stay. None other
ever seemed to be so needful to life itself. No
formal words were spoken, only cards exchanged
and carefully preserved. In two weeks her school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
would close, and she would spend the summer
northward at her home, and he would take a
long trip southward through various states, and
see what could be seen as far down as New
Orleans. They spent two afternoons in each
other’s company before the time of departure
came; correspondence was agreed upon, and in
the autumn they would meet and renew acquaintance
in the old posts of duty. Some slight
tokens were exchanged, and as they must they
nerved brave hearts for a long and perilous
separation.</p>

<p>When the time for their departure came they
were found seated side by side in the same old
coach, for Louisville. The ride was much shorter
and far more pleasant in that rich and beauteous
spring-time than in the ripe and luscious
autumn before.</p>

<p>Politics was a barren subject now. Homes
were admired as they passed along; bits of sentiment
indulged; snatches of song and lines of
poetry; much sober, sensible talk filled in the
hours which served as a needed respite to
minds kept hard at thought throughout the
year.</p>

<p>The future loomed up, real and grand. Their
lives took on a glow of interest and earnestness
of hope they never had known. There seemed
to be a reason in them now, before unseen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
They felt their worth and knew their joy, as
it was never felt or known before.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine took his southern trip, and made
business of it. He knew the history of all that
country, every state and town.</p>

<p>It had a vastly different look to him from
any region of the North which he had visited.
Slavery was the hideous monstrosity of evil that
met him everywhere. It was to him the great
contradiction and condemnation of the South.</p>

<p>He had heard and heard, but determined to
see for himself, and see he did. There was
much that seemed pleasant in plantation-life,
but when he went to the slave-pens and the
slave-auctions, and saw families broken and sold
asunder, and heard their cries, and saw the
blows,—their only recognition,—his patriot-blood
boiled fiercely in his veins. It was enough. He
sought his old home, and spent a happy month
or more with its loved ones, those who rejoiced
with him greatly over the achievements of the year.</p>

<p>Miss Stanwood made her journey northward
amid all the loveliness of Nature, and arrived
home far more the woman than when she left.
Life was more real and earnest now, and filled
with larger hopes. She was charmed with the
South, and had strange longings to return. But
letters are tell-tale things, for men, without any
special reason, will write a great, bold hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>James was able to lay two hundred dollars on
the table on his return, and entertained them
by the hour with stories of the South. He
had seen much gambling and drinking, many
bowie knives and revolvers, and seen many
splendid specimens of men.</p>

<p>He was filled with its beauties and glories,
and with its generous, kindly hospitalities. It
was a region so historic, so immense in possibilities,
so alive and magnificent with the old
ante-bellum greatness, and splendor of cities and
homes; so many graduates from Yale and Harvard,
which had been a dream of fame and greatness
ever to him; so many men of leisure,
and, withal, so much to see; so much of pleasing,
thrilling interest; so much stir and life,
that weeks passed by.</p>

<p>He spent parts of two winters in New Orleans.
He was, in fact, a southern man for the
time. His business was in the South, and his
great social powers gave him friends and entrance
everywhere.</p>

<p>The kind letters of his fellow-teachers,—Colonel
Thorndike F. Johnson, the principal of the
Academy, and Colonel Bushrod Johnson, after of
the Confederate army,—gave him many pleasing
acquaintances. This was twelve or fourteen years
before the war. The political business and educational
interests of the country were a unit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
There was no talk of rebels or of treason. The
prominent men of the country, politically, were
largely from the South. The presidents had
been selected largely from that section, and the
political contests throughout were carried on by
parties whose strongholds were North and South.
Only the summer before, President Polk had
made a tour through the Middle and Eastern
states, going eastward as far as Portland, Maine,
and was received with every demonstration of
respect. Nathan Clifford, of Maine, was his
Attorney-general, and Mr. Bancroft, his Minister
to England.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine’s father had moved to Washington,
as he was prothonotary of the courts, during his
term at college, so that he had made his home
with them during some of these years, and the
remainder of the time with a Mrs. Acheson.
He had ample opportunity to renew acquaintance
with old friends; with Prof. Wm. P. Aldrich, who
had drilled him so faithfully in mathematics:
with Prof. Richard Henry Lee, grandson of
Richard Henry Lee, of the Revolutionary war,
who was his professor of rhetoric and belle-lettres;
with his firm friend, Professor Murray,
who so inspired him in the study of the
languages, and gave Mr. Blaine a regular theological
drill in the study of Greek, that most
perfect receptacle of human thought, in all its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
shades and vastness, even now,—a language which
took up Christ, his kingdom, and his mission,
thoughts and doctrines, and perpetuated them
for the world.</p>

<p>No drill is more highly intellectual, more
conducive of fine taste, good judgment, and accuracy,
than the study of the Greek; and this
he had under the master-hand.</p>

<p>To Prof. Richard Henry Lee may be traced
the training of power so brilliantly displayed in
Mr. Blaine’s forensic efforts and on the stump.</p>

<p>To renew acquaintance with these men, and a
multitude of other friends, was a part of his
great pleasure. He was fresh and full as ever,
taller by an inch, and larger every way. He no
longer seemed to them a boy, but had the air
and manners of a man, and yet his laugh was
as merry and hearty, his shake of the hand as
vigorous and friendly as ever.</p>

<p>The sunny South shone full upon them in the
fresh report he brought. It was a goodly land,
and he had made it a study, bringing to bear
all his power of close observation.</p>

<p>He had taken his course at college principally
for the sake of study, simply, and the knowledge
he gained; but the prominent thought in
his mind had been journalism. This had not
been his purpose in education, but simply a chief
idea in his mind rather than a chosen aim in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
life. So that with this thought within him, and
the habit of seeing everything on him, but little
escaped the wide range of his vision during his
southern journeyings.</p>

<p>Of course when home he did not ignore the
old college-library. It was a resort so greatly
loved, and almost sacred.</p>

<p>But when the hour struck he was eager to
be off for his post of duty,—Kentucky. Promptness
and despatch were ever elements of power
with him. He reached Georgetown ahead of time,
and was rested and in readiness when the new
year of work began, and it was a year of hard,
steady, constant work with him. He not only
had now a reputation to sustain, but to be
greatly advanced. That a man stops growing
when he is satisfied, was a thing perfectly understood
by him. A man without ambition is
dead while he lives, and the one content to
live with his head over his shoulder may as
well be turned into a pillar of salt. It is the
men who look ahead, and who look up who have
a future. A backward look is a downward look to
them.</p>

<p>Competition was strong at the academy. Enthusiasm
was great. Professor Blaine had done
much to arouse it, but all unconsciously. He
had held steadily to his fixed habits of study,
preparing carefully for each recitation himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
permitting no shams in his class-room. The
military discipline at the institution aided greatly
its matter of discipline. Life and energy were
everywhere manifest.</p>

<p>And so the year passed with nothing special
worthy of note, except the amount of real work
performed, and the large measure of success
achieved.</p>

<p>Acquaintance with his lady friend was early
renewed and pleasantly continued. It had much
to do with the inspiration of the present and
in shaping his future. Of course it was kept a
profound secret, and no one in Kentucky permitted
to know that they were aught to each
other except chance friends, and indeed in point
of formal fact they were not until near the
close of the year, when the crisis came; but
the young professor was a gallant knight, and
had occasion required might readily have performed
some thrilling act of knighthood that
would have set the neighborhood agog, for
none can doubt he had it in him even then.
Milder methods have ever been his rule, except
emergency arise, and then he arises with it.</p>

<p>It is this ability of abilities, this almost perfection
of powers, that has made him equal to
every occasion, however dire or desperate opposition
may have been; that has given him his
great prominence in journalism, in halls of legislature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
both of state and nation, and in the field
of politics. But he has had this mountain-peak
of power because beneath and back of it lay a
long mountain-range of endeavor, capacity, and
growth.</p>

<p>The patient, hard, honest toil of years has
ever and anon had its culmination in hours of
splendid victory.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE years at Georgetown reviewed and
solidified the work of his student
scholarly life thus far, beside carrying
him forward to new fields of
conquest. Courtship could not interfere with
study and with work, and it did not.</p>

<p>This new relationship had changed somewhat
the plan of life. Other years could be but a
repetition of the two now nearly passed, so that
while he was in the line of promotion and in
a place to grow, it was not just the thing, so
he relinquished his professorship and went northward.</p>

<p>These years had been eventful in the history
of the country. The Mexican war had been
fought, and General Taylor, its hero, elected and
inaugurated president. Both were triumphs of
the Slave-Power.</p>

<p>President Polk had taken part in the ceremonies
attendant upon the inauguration of General
Taylor, and gone to his home in Tennessee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
by way of Richmond, Charleston, and New
Orleans, only to die on the 15th of June, 1849,
in the fifty-fourth year of his age.</p>

<p>The cholera was raging in the South “like a
desolating blast. It swept over the valley of
the Mississippi, carrying off thousands with the
suddenness of the plagues of the old world.”
The South was surely no place for northerners
at such a time.</p>

<p>The great gold-fever of California was on the
country, and scores were hurrying to the Pacific
coast. But Mr. Blaine had no taste for adventure,—no
thirst for gold. He was a man of
books and a man of affairs, profoundly interested
in all that pertained to the country, but too
young as yet either to hold office or vote.</p>

<p>He took his last winter’s journey to the South,
and returned home to find his father near his
end, at the age of fifty-five years.</p>

<p>James was now twenty years old, and the
pressure of new responsibilities was on him.
His attention is turned to business matters, and
he displays the same capacity and aptitude which
in fuller power have characterized him.</p>

<p>He early became impressed with the extent
and richness of the great coal-fields of Pennsylvania,
and before he was thirty years of age
made those investments which have so enriched
him in later years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>It is the part of wisdom and sagacity in men
to make the most of their first years, or the
first half of life. This is an eminent feature in
the career of Mr. Blaine. There are no wasted
years in his life; no baneful habits to destroy
his energies or dry up the fountain of his joys.
He is a clean, strong, vigorous man, and is
able to celebrate the year of his majority with
a more extensive preparation and experience as
scholar, teacher, traveler, and man of business,
and a brighter outlook for life, than falls to the
lot of many young Americans.</p>

<p>In this year of 1851 transpired the event
more propitious than any other. It was his
marriage, at Pittsburgh, to Miss Hattie Stanwood,
the present Mrs. Blaine, a lady of fine culture
and rare good sense, who loves her home
with the devotion of a true wife and noble
mother.</p>

<p>It would require the sagacity of a sage to
have predicted the future of Mr. Blaine, had it
not been his kindly fortune to have his life
crowned with so much of goodness, wisdom, intelligence,
and love, as is found in the companion
of his honors and joys.</p>

<p>Six children, now living, have come in these
years to honor their wedded life;—a goodly
family indeed.</p>

<p>It is perhaps not unworthy of remark that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
during an entire century of the nation’s life, but
one old bachelor was ever elected president, and
he the last resort of an expiring Democracy.</p>

<p>From 1852 to 1854 Mr. Blaine was principal
teacher in the Institution for the Blind at Philadelphia,
meanwhile reading law in the office of
Theodore Cuyler, who became a leading lawyer
in that famed city, eminent for the greatness of
the members of its bar.</p>

<p>These quiet years of reading and study and
teaching in a great degree fitted Mr. Blaine for
his career as a statesman.</p>

<p>He fitted himself for admission to the bar,
but never committed himself to the practice of
the profession by assuming its functions. The
love of journalism would not die. It was in his
heart. The time had come to give it light and
opportunity. Often had the attractions of the
Pine Tree state been presented to him by Mrs.
Blaine in all the glowing colors with which
youth is accustomed to paint the scenes that
lie near its heart. No state had the charms
for her possessed by the state of Maine. Here
she was born, and here those dearest to her
resided.</p>

<p>As yet they had not settled down for life.
The time had come for their decision. Her
powers of argument, and its very eloquence of
oratory, without aught of noise and gesture, but of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
simple and quiet way, were brought into requisition,
and it was decided not to go west and
grow up with the country, but go east and
grow where greatness has its models.</p>

<p>Maine has never wanted for great men; she
had them then, she has them to-day.</p>

<p>In 1854 Mr. Blaine removed with his family
to Augusta, the capital city of Maine, where he
has since resided.</p>

<p>He purchased, with Joseph Baker, the <i>Kennebec
Journal</i>, founded in 1823.</p>

<p>Now, the political field could be reviewed and
studied at will; the political arena was entered.
The paper had been first started by a meeting
of the principal citizens to found a Republican
paper, and such it was in real earnest. No
longer the secluded life of the student, or the
quiet life of the teacher.</p>

<p>Embarking in journalism at such a time was
like embarking on the sea, where storms and
collisions abound; where icebergs show themselves,
and rocks and reefs are found. No
country has more political storms and commotions,
perhaps, than America. They are of all
kinds and sizes, from city, town, county, up to
state and national storms, and blows, hurricanes,
and tempests. In those times of the slave
oligarchy, they beat with a fury unknown to-day.
Sometimes they were fierce in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
cruelty. It was a fight of great learning and
profound convictions on both sides, a fight of
dearest principle and of Christian faith.</p>

<p>President Taylor had died on the 9th of July,
1850, and Millard Fillmore served out his term
of office. March 4, 1853, Franklin Pierce, of
New Hampshire, who, in 1846, had declined to
be Attorney-general in President Polk’s cabinet;
also an appointment of United States Senator
by Governor Steele, and the Democratic nomination
for Governor, but had plunged into the
Mexican war and won his honors there, and who
stood at the head of the New Hampshire bar,
was inaugurated President, and ruled the nation
when Mr. Blaine became an editor. He had a
powerful cabinet, who, of course, were among
the prominent public men of the time.</p>

<p>When Mr. Blaine entered political life, though
not of his ilk, there were William L. Marcy, of
New York, Secretary of State; Robert M’Clelland,
of Michigan, Secretary of the Interior;
James Guthrie, of Kentucky, Secretary of the
Treasury; Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, Secretary
of War; James Dobbins, of North Carolina,
Secretary of the Navy; Caleb Cushing, of
Massachusetts, Attorney-general, and James Campbell,
of Pennsylvania, Postmaster-general. Webster,
Corwin, Stuart, Conrad, Graham, Crittenden,
and Hall had been in Mr. Fillmore’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
cabinet. The time for Republican victory was
drawing nigh, and the young editor was in position
to help bring it on.</p>

<p>It was the centennial of the city’s history.
The celebration was very beautiful, an account
of which appeared in Mr. Blaine’s paper, the
<i>Kennebec Journal</i>, of July 6, 1854, and seemed
auspicious of his arrival in the city, and the
inauguration of his work.</p>

<p>Augusta is about midway between towns that
boast two of the leading institutions of learning
in the state, Colby University at Waterville,
and Bowdoin College at Brunswick, where Longfellow
graduated, and his class-mate, Hon. James
W. Bradbury, who was, about this time, United
States Senator from Maine, when the great men
of the nation,—Webster, Clay, Calhoun, Douglas,
Cass, and others,—were discussing in the senate
the constitutional and slavery questions involved
in the compromise measures.</p>

<p>It was a time and place where great historic
interests centered. It had been the scene of
grave military operations, a fort and outposts on
the nation’s frontier, less than a hundred years
before, had been conspicuous in the French and
Indian wars.</p>

<p>The mind of Blaine was not long, with his
practical methods of historic research, in threading
out lines of history, entering the labyrinths of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
knowledge of a mighty past, and a great and
wondrous present, boxing the compass historically,
as it were, until he knew the past and present
of his adopted state, and of New England, as
he had known his native state.</p>

<p>He came with no beat of drum and blare of
trumpet, but quietly, with no parade or display,
and went to work with good grace and strong
determination. He brought his capital with him.
It had not been embezzled, nor squandered, nor
stolen. It was in a portable bank in which he
had been depositing his investments, or investing
his deposits, steadily for nearly twenty years.
Already he had drawn compound interest, and
yet, unlike air, water or money, the more he
drew, the more there was on deposit, bright
and clear with the polish of the mint. He had
invested in solid, reliable knowledge and education.
He had taken stock in James G. Blaine,
taught and trained him to think, to know, to
talk, to write, and act. There is always a demand
for just such men. Communities want
them, the state and nation wants them. From
the distant South, explored and carefully surveyed
and estimated, he had come to the farthermost
North and East, and here for life his
home is to be.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>T was not the policy of Mr. Blaine to
undertake a work for which he was
not specially fitted. General adaptation
and preparation were not enough; he
must be master of the situation or not at all,
so he did not sit down in the editorial chair at
once. He was among a new people. He must
know them. His paper was published at the
state capital. He must know the state. He
must know it politically, socially, morally, educationally,
religiously. This required extensive travel.
He must understand the demands of the people,
their character and temperament.</p>

<p>The <i>Kennebec Journal</i> had not yet risen to
that standard of circulation and of excellence,
its position warranted and required. In the words
of one thoroughly conversant with its affairs,
“The paper was badly run down.” It was the
opposition paper, and had long been what, in
common parlance is known as “the under dog in
the fight.” There was the largest opportunity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
for the display of the new editor’s push and
tact in business matters. To these two things,
therefore,—public acquaintance and business
affairs,—he gave himself until November, 1854.</p>

<p>About this time a turn came in the political
tide, and William Pitt Fessenden, “that good
Whig,” was elected to the United States senate,
routing the Pillsbury Democracy. Governor
Crosby and his council were also Whigs.</p>

<p>Everything of a political character seemed
highly favorable for the best editorial work, just
as after the war the highest statesmanship was
requisite to garner and perpetuate its results,
crystalize its victories, and thus secure their
glory untarnished.</p>

<p>So now conservatism, power, and radical might,—the
one to hold, and the other to defend what
had been gained,—were needful. It did not take
long to catch the spirit of the hour. Mr. Blaine
had been familiar with the fight from boyhood,
and in the great campaign of General Harrison
had seen, upon a grander scale, a similar victory.
Now he was on the stage of action, in the
responsibilities of life.</p>

<p>He had really entered the state in one of the
happiest years, politically, of her history. It was
not until several years later that the legislature
of his old state of Pennsylvania defeated the
express wish of President Buchanan upon this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
same issue, and sent Gen. Simon Cameron to
the senate in place of Mr. Buchanan’s selected
candidate, John W. Forney. This, at the time,
was said to be one of the most severe blows
his administration could receive.</p>

<p>In Maine it was the voice of the people
against the nefarious attempt to fasten slavery
upon the territories, and against the repeal of
the Missouri Compromise. Then the opponents
of slavery were not all abolitionists. They were
rather restrictionists. In an address delivered by
Henry Ward Beecher about this time, he makes
these two points,—</p>

<p>First.—“We must hedge in slavery as far as
possible.”</p>

<p>Second.—“Ameliorate the condition of the
blacks to the extent of our ability.”</p>

<p>There were, indeed, abolitionists then, red hot,
just as there are prohibitionists now, and as
events have proved, they were the vanguard of
Vicksburg and Gettysburgh, where there were no
compromises of the Missouri, or any other kind,
and no Mason and Dixon’s line, but lines of
battle. And in the one case the words “surrender
of slaves,” written with bayonets dipped
in blood, and in the other, resounding from
cannon and battle charge, the only alternative,
“give in or go under.”</p>

<p>But the great political battles were being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
fought now, not to kill men, but to save them,
and to avert, if possible, the dread arbitrament
of civil war with its consequences, more dire
than pen could write or tongue could tell. It
was a time for greatest wisdom and loftiest
courage.</p>

<p>Political life was the life of a soldier, and
the political field a field of battle, as the assault
upon Charles Sumner and Horace Greeley,
at the nation’s capital testify.</p>

<p>No wonder the wise and prudent Pennsylvanian
surveyed the field with great deliberation,
and gained the fullest possible knowledge of the
situation ere he balanced his spear for its first
lunge. It was but the putting on of his full
armor ere the soldier enters the fray. It was
no business venture or financial investment
merely, but rather the solemn dedication of himself
to the nation’s weal.</p>

<p>Then and there the public career begins that
has brought him to this hour. It is a career
of alternate wildest storm and serenest sunshine.
There were at this time, practically, four
parties in Maine, and two great questions, both
of them moral in character, namely: Temperance
and Slavery. The Democratic party was split
into two most radical sections, with slavery for
their dividing line. Beside these were the
Whigs and Liberalists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>The birth-hour of the Republican party was
near at hand. The elements were in existence
demanding organization. Already men in sympathy
with each other upon the great questions of
the day in the different parties and divisions
had acted together upon occasions of great political
importance, as in the election of Mr. Fessenden,
an ardent Whig, to the senate. Anti-slavery
men, of the Democratic party, could and
did vote for him. The nation demanded the
man, somewhat as to-day she demands another
son of Maine. The <i>New York Tribune</i>, in an
issue prior to his election, said,—“The nation
wants him.” Not party names, but principles,
ruled the hour.</p>

<p>Less than ninety days after Mr. Blaine, quill
in hand, made his bow on the 10th of November,
1854, to the people of Augusta and to the
state of Maine, the Republican party was in
existence, a full-fledged organization. Conventions
had met a little earlier in Wisconsin and in
one of the counties of Maine for a similar purpose.
Mr. Blaine was with the movement, heart
and soul. He was present at its birth, and rejoiced
in its existence. It had come into existence
full of life and power, as it had taken
nearly all the life and power out of the other
parties.</p>

<p>It had taken a minority of the Democrats, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
majority of the Whigs, and all of the Anti-slavery
or Liberty party. “Liberty national, Slavery
sectional,” was upon its shield. No one, of
course, stopped to ask, in the rejoicing of the
hour, how in the name of reason liberty could
be national and slavery sectional. But they
were organized for victory, as right against
wrong. How auspicious and full of promise that
Mr. Blaine should celebrate the twenty-fifth year
of his remarkable life by entrance with this
party of progress and of power upon its marvelous
career, himself an integral part of it, and
a power within it.</p>

<p>About this time John L. Stevens, a man of
great good sense, takes Mr. Baker’s place, a
large law-practice demanding his attention, as
co-editor of the <i>Journal</i>. But Mr. Stevens is
so occupied with the details of party organization,
that most of the editorial work at this
time falls to Mr. Blaine, and it shows great
vigor and ability.</p>

<p>One who was associated with him intimately
at this time, in professional life, speaks of him
as “a man of great natural and acquired ability,
and of adaptation, familiar with all questions of
government, with a remarkable facility for getting
at the core of a question, a man of genius and
talent to a striking degree”; and as we went
over year after year of editorials, some of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
very striking and forceful in their headings,
about the time the young party of great men
was fairly on its feet, and had become the target
for rifle shots from the enemy, the old man
turned, and with that peculiar emphasis which
always comes with conviction of the truth, said,
“He always calculated to draw blood, if there
was a tender spot.”</p>

<p>He invariably struck to demolish when fighting
his great political battles. There was no
play about it, and none could doubt the moral
earnestness of the man. It was a battle of
great moral ideas with him all the way through.</p>

<p>But his work was more largely literary in
conducting the paper. It would be difficult to
find more solid or instructive reading in any
paper during those years. Mr. Blaine was himself
a great reader of the best journals and reviews,
and with a high standard ever before
him, not only in his own ideals, but also in
the great papers of the nation at his command,
and having high aims and a mind whose rich
stores were constantly increased, and with all
his varied powers of expression, books were reviewed,
the substance of lectures given, and the
best lecturers of the day entertained Augusta
audiences, and a multitude of articles upon
various subjects abounded.</p>

<p>Within fifty days after he became editor, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
legislature met, and it devolved on him to gather
in the substance of their speeches and addresses,
and record the principal part of their doings.
This brought him into immediate and extensive
acquaintance with members of the senate, whose
hall he chose to visit chiefly. They soon became
acquainted with him, and saw and felt his
power.</p>

<p>His life was stirring and active, and upon a
scale quite in contrast with the life of a recluse
teaching in the Blind Institute in Philadelphia,
and quietly reading law only a year before.</p>

<p>Though a man of strong impulse at times,
it is intelligent, purposeful, and under such control
that upon such occasions he has won his
highest praise for brilliancy. He has made mistakes
and blunders, and has had his share of
regrets and misgivings, giving ample proof that
he is a member of the human family.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine’s old foreman, who was afterwards
proprietor of the paper, Howard Owen, says that
he wrote most of his editorials at home, and
came down to the office to see his numerous
friends, and that they would have great times
pounding for “copy” while he was entertaining
hosts of friends in the office below. One who
knows him well has written of him as a conversationalist.</p>

<p>Mr. Blame has few equals. He has a keen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
appreciation of fun, and can tell a story with a
wonderful simplicity. There is no dragging prelude,
no verbose details preceding a stupid finale;
the story is presented always dramatically, and
fired almost as from a gun, when the point is
reached.</p>

<p>The dinner-table in the Blaine house is the
place where the gayest of good-natured pleasantry
rules. From six to eight the dinner speeds under
cover of running talk upon the incidents of
the day.</p>

<p>Mr. Owen says that “when they came to ‘making
up the form’ Mr. Blaine would stand over
him and attend to every detail, decide the location
of every article, and give just that prominence
that would produce the best effect.” It
showed the interest he took in the children of
his own brain, and the great activity of the
man.</p>

<p>His force of intellect, strength of constitution,
and great endurance have been a marvel to
many.</p>

<p>He has lived his life on a rising tide, amid
immense prosperity, and the great cheerfulness of
temper thus produced has made life less a drag
and more a joy to him.</p>

<p>He struck the current at the start, caught at
its flood that “tide in the affairs of men that
leads on to fortune.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>He got into the national drift of the new
party and has kept it ever since. It was like
a splendid ship, all staunch and strong, launched
at his hand; he sprang aboard, was soon at the
helm, and has steadily passed along the line of
honorable promotion.</p>

<p>There have been storms whose fury has
been terrific; and there have been triumphs
whose brightness has reflected the nation’s
glory.</p>

<p>The paper improved in every way. They procured
the state printing, and an increased circulation.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine’s pleasant home on Green Street,
where most of his children were born, was one
of comfort and happiness.</p>

<p>He soon became a favorite in Augusta, and
among the public men of the state. People love
to hear good things said well, and he never
failed in this.</p>

<p>He soon appears on the Republican Central
Committee. The party is victorious from the
start, and elects Anson P. Morrill Governor.
Mr. Morrill is still living in Augusta, hale and
hearty at eighty-one, a great reader, and soon
after his nomination called upon Mr. Blaine to
congratulate him. The name of J. G. Blaine
appears as chairman of the Republican Central
Committee soon after its organization, and the
following year he is presented as a candidate
for the legislature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>He enters a city seventy-five years older than
himself, rich with numbers of strong men, but
is taken up and speedily honored with a place
in the councils of the state.</p>

<p>It was an era of great and almost constant
political conventions. The remnants of the Whig
party and the Know-nothings kept up a struggle
for existence, but they were doomed, and failed
to submit gracefully to the inevitable. They
must be watched and won, if possible, to the
new party of the future, whose substantial, steadfast
principles,—as expressed by Mr. Blaine and
his editorial colleague, Joseph Baker, in their inaugural,—were
freedom, temperance, river and
harbor improvement within constitutional limits,
homesteads for freemen, and a just administration
of the public lands of the state and nation;
and the present testifies how well those principles,
embracing all that were needful then in a
political party, have been carried out.</p>

<p>The words “Liberty” and “Freedom,” in Mr.
Blaine’s paper always began with capital letters.</p>

<p>The religious tone and character of the paper
is worthy of note. It furnished a column of
“Religious Intelligence” each week. Many of
its selected articles, notices of books, its correspondence,
and even editorials, were deeply religious.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
The work of that time was solemn, serious
business. There was much of the Puritan
and Pilgrim in the people then. There was a
reliance upon God, a demand for his wisdom
expressed in prayer and song and sermon, that
told that the importance and magnitude of the
great principles at stake were fully appreciated.
There had been so much failure in the past,
so many parties had been organized and proved
inadequate, and still the encroachments of slavery,
the nation’s foe, continued with an audacity
unparalleled. Already Kansas was conceded
to the slave-power; secession was already in the
air. The great war was only seven years in
the future. A Charleston paper had stated the
issue distinctly, “We must give up slavery or
secede,” as it viewed the first contests and
sweeping victories of the new party. And Mr.
Blaine, in a ringing editorial of caustic power,
quoting the entire paragraph, said, “This is the
exact issue, squarely stated.”</p>

<p>His life in Kentucky and extensive winter
trips through the South had been a revelation
to him, and were now an inspiration. He knew
what was in the South, and he knew what was
in the North, and he knew that they could not
keep house together for centuries, with slaves in
the country, without quarreling. And, moreover,
he knew that the destinies of the country could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
not be divided. She could not remain half slave
and half free. The South itself was not satisfied
with this, as all their measures of legislation at
their various state capitals, and in Washington
clearly indicated. Slavery must conquer or be
conquered. Blaine saw it at that early day, as
anyone may in the light of more recent events.</p>

<p>But this was not the position or demand of
the Republican party then. Anti-slavery did not
mean abolition. In 1855 the Free Democratic
party, as it was called, was achieving victories
in the state of New York, and various phases
of the great question were championed in different
states and sections, until the election of Abraham
Lincoln in 1860. And it was not until about two
years of the war were gone, and it was imperatively
demanded as a war-measure; not until it
had been held back for months by the sagacious
Lincoln, after it was written, that the emancipation
of the slave was proclaimed in states
then in armed rebellion. But it was a fact
fated and decreed, signed, sealed, and delivered
in a higher than earthly tribunal, long years
before.</p>

<p>There are always high-wrought souls, keenly
alive and sensitive to issues of the hour, who
seem ordained to catch the foreshadowing of
events and report to others of duller and heavier
mould. Mr. Blaine had projected himself upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
the future with the use of his princely personal
power, and with an eagle eye had read
out the doom and destiny of that “peculiar
institution” which violated the fundamental principle
of the government, the great end for which
it was established,—a doom which nothing could
avert. God’s time for liberty had come, and
chosen men far out upon the frontier of human
thought had watched its dawn and seen it mount
the heavens.</p>

<p>But first, the shining of this same sun must
produce a similar harvest of ideas, where the
mists of a false and sophistical political philosophy,
and the fogs of a wrong and vicious science
of government, and an unnatural and cruel selfishness
and monopoly of liberty prevent the
cleanest vision, the fullest knowledge, and the
most righteous thought.</p>

<p>At this time Mr. Blaine was closely and
sharply following the course of the Pro-slavery
party. We give a single extract from his paper
in 1855, as showing what facts the party had
to stir its thought and fire its heart,—facts
that read strangely in the light of to-day, and
which had a strange, ominous look even then.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Slave Trade</span>—It is said that the business of
fitting out slavers is carried on extensively in New
York. The <i>Commercial Advertiser</i> believes the practice
to be ‘alarmingly and disgracefully prevalent,’ and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
<i>Tribune</i> states, on good authority, that thirty vessels
are annually fitted out there, for the purpose of procuring
slaves upon the west coast of Africa.</p>

<p>“This is no more than following out the political
creed of the more advanced wing of the progressive
pro-slavery Democracy. The Charleston papers, which
support President Pierce’s administration, boldly advocate
the re-opening of the African Slave Trade, with
the view of making ‘niggers’ cheaper. The ‘party’
in New England are not as yet up to the work, but
another Presidential election will <i>fetch</i> them. <i>Progress</i>
is the distinct feature of the age.”</p>
</div>

<p>Some are ready now with their verdict of
principle, despite the mists and fogs and storms;
yet not all. The party of Freedom organized in
counties and states all over the country, must
be brought together, unified and organized as a
great national party; a convention must be held
and all must be invited who can be induced to
affiliate. It is a preliminary meeting, as it precedes
the great organization. They want to
get acquainted and see their strength. It is to
be a time of great argument and powerful
speeches. Where so appropriate to hold it as in
the goodly city of Philadelphia? Whigs, Know-nothings,
Free-soilers, are to be there; anti-slavery
Democrats, and staunch Republicans.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine was there. It continued for eight
days. Its value lay in the full and free discussion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
of the absorbing questions of the day, by
people widely separated and subjected to varied
local influences. Men were influenced by mercantile
and commercial, by social and domestic
interests; by educational and religious interests,
and it is almost impossible for many minds of
most excellent, though conservative quality, to rise
above fixed orders of things to the clear apprehension
and vigorous grasp of a great principle.</p>

<p>Early education or neglect, also, may have
dwarfed or blunted perceptions and capabilities;
but, however, they came largely to see, eye to
eye, and great progress was made. There was
a lengthening of cords and strengthening of
stakes, and on the 22d of February, 1856, the
Republicans met in Pittsburgh and appointed its
national committee, and arranged for its first
nominating convention. The aim of the party,
according to Mr. Blaine’s voluminous report, had
been declared to be “the restoration of the
government to the policy of its founders; its
ideal of patriotism, the character of Washington;
its vital philosophy, that of Jefferson; its watchwords,
American enterprise and industry, Slavery
sectional, Freedom national.”</p>

<p>The delegates of twelve Northern states withdrew
from the Philadelphia convention, and left
the New York and Southern delegates to their
fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>Mr. Blaine’s work is principally at home, within
the boundaries of his adopted state. But fiercer
than ever, the fires of the great conflict are raging.</p>

<p>Jefferson has remarked, that “in the unequal
contest between freedom and oppression, the Almighty
had no attribute that could take part
with the oppressor.” And yet the Democratic
party, in violation of its name and prestige
could invoke the shades of this great man;
could continue its warfare upon the life of the
nation, and its encroachments upon the constitution,
and violation of a plighted faith wherever
slavery made its frightful demands.</p>

<p>At the head of his editorial column, Mr.
Blaine kept these words, printed in capitals,
from the last great speech delivered by Henry
Clay in the United States senate, “I repeat it,
sir, I never can and I never will, and no
earthly power can make me vote, directly or
indirectly, to spread slavery over territory where
it does not exist. Never, while reason holds its
seat in my brain; never, while my heart sends
its vital fluid through my veins, <span class="allsmcap">NEVER</span>!”</p>

<p>Wm. H. Seward was battling against “the fall
of constitutional liberty” in the senate. The
Fugitive Slave Act had passed in 1850, and the
Missouri Compromise abrogated in 1854, and
now an extreme measure is pending to protect
United States officers in the arrest of fugitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
slaves. Mr. Blaine prints the great speech in
full. It had the true Republican ring.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine’s final editorial for 1855, prior to
the Republican convention, and first presidential
campaign, is every way so fine a summary of
the situation, and affords so clear a view of the
man in all the moral earnestness of his powers
and wide comprehension of the subject, that we
give two or three extracts from his editorial in
the <i>Kennebec Journal</i> of Dec. 28, 1855, on the
“Condition of the Country”:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is the settled judgment of our ablest and best
statesmen, that the present is a more momentous
period than any through which the country has passed
since the Revolution. The issue is fairly before the
American people, whether Democracy or Aristocracy,
Liberty or Despotism, shall control the government
of this Republic.... The contest enlists on one
side the intelligence, the conscience, the patriotism,
and the best energies of the American people. On
the other are engaged the avarice, the servility, the
ignorance, and the lust of dominion which characterize
human depravity in every age and nation.</p>

<p>“There are in reality but two sides to this great
question. There is no ground of neutrality. As true
now is it as it was in the days of the Great Teacher
of liberty and salvation, that men cannot serve opposite
principles at the same time.... The deepening
cry from all quarters is that the White House
must be cleansed, and all the channels to and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
the same thoroughly renovated. The march of slavery
must be stopped or the nation is lost. Only by the
firm and practical union of all true men in the nation
can its most valuable interests be preserved.</p>

<p>... “We are, then, for a common union
against the National Administration, on the basis of
restoring the Missouri Prohibition against slavery in
the territories, forgetting past distinctions and priority
in the combination. Who shall be the standard-bearer
of this patriotic and conservative Opposition
in the great struggle of ’56? Whoever the right man
may be,—whether he has his home in the East or
the West, in the North or the South, we care not,
if he is but the statesman to comprehend the hour,
and is equal to the necessities of the country, we
hope to see him triumphantly elected. We only ask
that he be loyal to Liberty, a sworn defender of the
Union on its constitutional basis, in favor of bringing
back our government to the principles and policy of
its founders, and pledged to undo the giant wrong
of 1854. To enlist in such an opposition, patriotism,
the memory of our Revolutionary sires, everything
sacred in our history, the welfare of posterity, invoke
us. In such a ‘union for the sake of the Union’
we shall all be Republicans, all Whigs, all Democrats,
all Americans.”</p>

and its foes are to feel its power.
Men had been hearing the voice
of conscience on the moral questions of the
nation. Money had stiffled it with some; for
others the climate and location were not propitious;
blight and mildew had struck some,—darkness
to them was light, black was white.
Some, perchance, held the truth in unrighteousness;
trimmers and time-servers abounded. But
the press and the pulpit had been great educators.
God was in the contest, and it was beginning
to be apparent. There were light and
glory all about the sky, but reformations that
reform, and revolutions that revolutionize have
in them not only forceful, but voluntary powers.
There are always those who will not be persuaded
or won, on all grave questions. They
must be passed by or overpowered.</p>

<p>To get men into position upon all questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
of the nation’s life and destiny, it is needful to
first get the questions into position. Republicans
had undertaken a herculean task. It was
not the emancipation of slaves, but of the nation
itself. The thraldom of a mighty woe was on
her.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine entered the year with the same
great purpose, and the same bold enunciation of
principles. He was a true knight. His pen was
mightier than the sword. It was never idle,
never cold. From home to office, and office to
senate, and back to office and home he went,
day by day, wherever truth and right could be
served.</p>

<p>Washington’s birthday came soon, and with it
the Republican gathering at Pittsburgh, and then
the great convention that nominated Frémont
and Dayton at Philadelphia, in the summer of
1856;—Blaine was there; it was on his native
heather. Never had men listened so intently
since the farewell address of Washington; rarely
had they thought, and felt, and resolved so
deeply. Conscience and will, intelligence and
love, were in all they thought, and said, and
did. They chose their men for standard-bearers,
and fought out the hard, bitter fight. It was a
good fight, and they kept the faith.</p>

<p>It was on his return from the convention in
Philadelphia that he was selected, of all who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
went, to report to the citizens at home. It was
his first oratorical effort in Augusta, if not his
first since leaving college. His pen had done
the work. There had been no demand for oratory.
He surprised himself and astonished his
hearers, and from that hour the door was open
for him to enter the state legislature.</p>

<p>An old friend and neighbor of Mr. Blaine has,
since his nomination, given the following sketch
of the speech:—</p>

<p>“This was his first public effort. He was then
twenty-six years of age. Although remarkably
ready and easy of speech and holding a practiced
and powerful pen, he had an almost unconquerable
repugnance to letting his voice be
heard, except in familiar conversation, where his
brilliant powers of statement and argument, his
marvelous memory of dates and events in political
history, and his acquaintance with, and keen
estimate of the public men and parties of the
day, were the delight and wonder of all who
listened to him. The writer well recalls the
trepidation, at once painful and ludicrous, with
which he rose to address the meeting. In confronting
the sea of faces, almost every one of
which was known to him, he seemed to be
struggling to master the terror that possessed
him. He turned pale and red by turns, and
almost tottering to the front, he stood trembling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
until the generous applause which welcomed him
had died away, when, by a supreme effort, he
broke the spell, at first by the utterance of
some hesitating words of greeting and thanks,
and then gathering confidence, he went on with
a speech which stirred the audience as with the
sound of a trumpet, and held all present in
breathless interest and attention to its close.
From that moment Mr. Blaine took rank among
the most effective popular speakers of the day;
but it may be doubted if among the many maturer
efforts of his genius and eloquence upon
the political platform or the legislative tribune,
he has ever excited an audience to a more passionate
enthusiasm, or left a profounder impression
upon the minds and hearts of his hearers.”</p>

<p>His editorials of this year would fill a large
volume, and all bold, trenchant, and uncompromising
in tone. His experience of the year before
had just fitted him for this hard, strong
work. The temptation is exceedingly great to
make copious extracts, for it is our single effort
to cause the man to appear in all the just and
worthy splendor of his enduring manhood, and
if a scar is found in all of wide research, no
hand shall cover it.</p>

<p>Not alone the great cause, but the great men
who embodied it, were to him an inspiration.
Next to books, men were his study. He studied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
the nation in them, and all the questions they
incarnated. Henry Wilson was to him an inspiration.
“All praise to the cold and lofty bearing
of Henry Wilson at the Philadelphia convention,”
he writes of him in his issue of June 22, 1854.
And all the great, strong men of the party
loomed up before him at full stature, and had a
large place in his affections. They were the
apostles of liberty to him.</p>

<p>The last year of Mr. Blaine’s journalistic career
in Augusta was tame compared with other
years, and yet the paper continued a splendid
specimen of what the leading paper at the state
capital ought to be,—rich in every department,
and justly noted for the courage and acumen
of its editorial writings.</p>

<p>The great presidential campaign had resulted
in the election of James Buchanan, to whom
the <i>Richmond Enquirer</i> immediately gave this
friendly word of caution: “The president elect
will commit a fatal folly if he thinks to organize
his administration upon any other principle
than that of an avowed and inflexible support
of the rights and institutions of the slave-holding
states. He who is not with us is against
us, and the South cannot attach itself to an
administration which occupies a <i>neutral</i> ground,
without descending from its own lofty and impregnable
position.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>In announcing the cabinet of Mr. Buchanan
and the Dred Scott decision in the same issue,
Mr. Blaine says,—“The conquest of slavery is
complete. President, cabinet, congress, judiciary,
treasury, army, navy, the common territory of
the union are all in its hands to be directed as
its whims shall direct.” The five great acts in
the drama of national shame and degradation he
mentions as, “the Fugitive Slave Act, repeal of
the Missouri Compromise, the raid on Kansas,
election of James Buchanan, and the supreme
court decision in the Dred Scott case.”</p>

<p>It was a great deal for the nation to endure,
but it was the thing to arouse the nation to
the iniquity to be overthrown by the Republican
party in the next election. Five of the nine
judges were from the South, and two of the
others, Nelson and Grier, were selected with
special regard to their fidelity to the slave-holding
interests of the South.</p>

<p>But there was some honor and joy in the
fact that Hannibal Hamlin was Governor of
Maine, and United States senator elect. His
inaugural address Mr. Blaine heads,—“A Paralytic
Stroke.”</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a time for great men to speak
out, and this Mr. Hamlin did with power. So
greatly had the <i>Journal</i> prospered under the
firm management of Stevens and Blaine, that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
removed from the office at the corner of Oak
and Water Streets, which it had occupied for
twenty-four years, and at great expense, added
new and improved machinery. This had scarcely
been done a month when Mr. Blaine’s name
disappears from its management. He had sold
his interest in the paper for “a good, handsome
price,” and invested it all, beside money loaned
from a brother-in-law, in coal lands in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>He urged his partner, Mr. Stevens, to
sell out his interest and do the same. This
investment, says Mr. Stevens, was very fortunate,
and has yielded him handsome returns.
But Mr. Blaine was wanted on the <i>Portland
Daily Advertiser</i>. John M. Wood, a man of
wealth, owned it, and was looking around for an
able editor. Mr. Blaine had acquired a reputation
as editor, and was offered the position, which
he accepted at three thousand dollars a year
salary, but never removed to Portland.</p>

<p>This year of 1857 is remembered as the year
of the great financial crash. It was anything
but a crash to Mr. Blaine. He had sold his
paper, which he had brought into a leading position
in state journalism, at a large advance,
made a profitable investment of his funds, gone
on a salary of the first-class, for the time, and
also been nominated and elected a member of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
the state legislature, as one of the two representatives
of the city of Augusta.</p>

<p>His popularity is seen in the fact that at the
time of this seeming break-up, when if he had
been a machine man with insatiable political aspirations
he would certainly have held on to his
paper, and parted with it at no price, he artlessly
sells out and enters business about eighty
miles from home. But the people wanted him.
He would not leave their midst. He had served
the cause of his espousal with ability and fidelity
for three years, and the time had come to
honor him.</p>

<p>It is not often that a man so young comes
into an old established state, and in a time so
brief makes for himself a name and a place so
large.</p>

<p>It is only needful to read over the files of
that paper from the first hour his pen touched
it to see that he had made for himself a place
so large. He had put himself into its columns,
and so into the life both of the state and the
nation. He lived, and thought, and wrought
for that paper. That was the instrument of his
power. The bold thunder of artillery is heard
along its columns; the charge of cavalry and
the sweep of infantry are seen and felt upon its
pages. There is push, and dash, and rush, and
swing, and hurrah along the whole battle-line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
where he stood and fought through those years.
It was a manly fight. He stood squarely to the
line. It was all upon the broad scale of the
nation’s existence and welfare. He spoke the
truth as such; he had no dreams to tell.</p>

<p>He took no vacation, but summer and winter
was at his post. In July and August there is
no relaxation, but the same dash of breakers on
the shore. No wonder he was in demand elsewhere,
and the fee was large. He was a business
success, and had made a success of politics
thus far. The first Republicans of Maine
had gone into office mid the glow of his
genius, and now his turn had come. It was a
weekly before, but now it was a daily, and a
seat in the legislature to fill beside. But he
was abreast of the times, a full man, a large
man, with immense capabilities of work, and a
strong, tenacious memory, or he could never
have done the work of two men steadily, and
four men much of the time, and a man destined
for leadership. He took to Portland all his
powers, and soon was felt as fire is felt, or the
rising sun, for foes and friends learned speedily
of his presence. Every day was a field-day in
politics then. It was a political revival all the
year round. No ponds or pools were visible.
There were currents in every stream. There
was a mighty flood to the tides. The states<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
were raising men and building characters. They
were mining gold and minting it. Life then
was a Bessemer steel-process; the heat was intense,
and hydraulic pressure drove out all impurities.
The great columbiads that did the
execution were cast before the war; they were
large of calibre and deep of bore, and thoroughly
rifled, for it was the men who manned
the guns in war times who made the guns man
the rebellion.</p>

<p>The clouds are drawing water and marshaling
forces for the sweep of a mighty storm,—the storm
of a righteous judgment, of a holy justice. It was
God’s storm and must come. Already the lightning
played furiously along the sky, and mutterings
of thunder could be distinctly heard. The
air grew thick, and heavy, and dark. All signs
were ominous. From throne to cloud, and cloud
to brain, and brain to pen, the electric current
flew. Men were thinking the thoughts of God.
They were being filled with his vision and armed
with his purpose. No times were grander since
men had pledged their lives, and fortunes, and
sacred honor at the shrine of Liberty, for its
perpetuation; and now their sons from heights of
manhood just as lofty, were breathing the same
spirit and plighting the same faith. How men
stretch upward to a kingly height when such
grand occasions come, or wither and waste like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
froth on the billows that charge along the
shore!</p>

<p>It was promotion to rank of greater influence
when Mr. Blaine took his sceptre of power in
Portland. Six times a week instead of once, he
went out in teeming editorials to the people.
Every department of the paper was enriched and
felt the thrill of his presence. He was a graduate
in journalism now. Its ways were all familiar.
His study of it and experience had brought
him the ability of hard, rapid work. It was the
testimony of his old associate at Augusta, that
he would go at once to the core of a subject,
and get the wheat out of the chaff. The beginning
and ending of an article, he said, were
its heavy parts, and Mr. Blaine knew just where
to look, whether in newspaper, review, or book.</p>

<p>He always found what he wanted, and so was
always armed to the teeth with fact and incident,
with argument and illustration. He had
the eye and ear and pen of the true journalist.</p>

<p>Some men have a peculiar faculty for getting
at what is going on. They seem to know by
instinct. It is not always told them, but they
are good listeners, as all great men are. They
are men of great industry; search and research
are ever the order with them.</p>

<p>Some men are sound asleep when the decisive
hours of life are passing, others seem ever awake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
It is this ability to see, and hear, and feel, to
catch and ever know, that has made Mr. Blaine
a living centre of the political intelligence of his
time. As a student of history he had learned
the ways of men and nations, the policies of
governments, and the methods of their execution,
their meteorology, mineralogy, and ways of navigation,—for
nations have all of these, political
weather, materials of construction, together with
tides and currents in their affairs, besides rocks
and reefs and coasts of danger. The right ways
are always the great ways, the light the best
ways.</p>

<p>All the light of any subject comes from the
truth it holds within, and the man of mastery
is the man of light and life and energy. It is unfilled
capacity that makes of so many the sounding
brass and tinkling cymbal. Unfed, untrained,
and unworked minds have filled the world with
wrecks.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine is climbing the ladder now. Coming
up out of the ranks, as some must come, with
worth or worthlessness.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Heaven is not reached by a single bound,</div>
<div class="verse">But we climb the ladder by which we rise.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>It was General Taylor’s great difficulty in
Mexico to bring on a battle. This at times requires
the ablest generalship; but this he finally
succeeded in doing at Buena Vista, and so created<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
the occasion of his greatest victory. This
was a power in the tactics of Mr. Blaine. He
was never afraid to attack, and never out of ammunition,
however long the siege or strong the
foe.</p>

<p>Soon after he entered the legislature Mr.
Blaine encountered Ephraim K. Smart, one of the
greatest men of his party, a man who had been
in congress, and afterward was twice their candidate
for governor. While in congress he had
opposed the extension of slavery in Kansas, and
the repeal of the Missouri Compromise which
limited slavery to the Southern states; but now,
during the Buchanan régime, when the party
seemed hopelessly sold to slavery, he went back
on his record, swore by the party, and stood by
its record, regardless of his own.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine was thoroughly posted, and when
the time came turned it against him in debate.
It was a time of danger at the nation’s capital;
assaults were frequent, thrilling scenes were enacted
everywhere. Each hour brought the country
nearer the verge of war. Our man was fearless
and he was strong,—strong in the right,
strong in his knowledge of the situation, strong
in the command of his powers; so with his ever
aggressive spirit of true progress, he hurled his
lance. With a merciless skill he unfolded the
history of the man, with all of its inconsistencies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
sophistry, and contradiction, and reaching
the climax he held it up to view, and advancing
towards him (his name was Ephraim), he said,
with great dramatic power, “Ephraim is a cake
unturned, and we propose to turn him.”</p>

<p>Imagine if you can the bewildered consternation
of the man! It was one of Mr. Blaine’s
first triumphs in the house, and a stride toward
the speaker’s chair.</p>

<p>With this same spirit and power he did his
work at Portland. His position afforded him the
best opportunity for news of every sort, and his
legislative work was largely in the line of his
editorial, so that preparation for the one was fitness
for the other. Yet life was full to the
brim. He was a man of immense vitality, and
is to-day, as almost daily intercourse with him
can testify.</p>

<p>The first day of his duties in the legislature
he is appointed chairman of a committee of five
to inform the newly-elected governor, Lot M.
Morrill, of his election. Thus he is recognized
and honored as the chief one, worthy to represent
the body in the presence of the governor.</p>

<p>A few days after, he presented a long, well-worded
resolution that the house, in concurrence
with the senate, according to certain forms of
law indicated, proceed, upon the following Tuesday,
at twelve o’clock, to elect a United States senator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
to succeed Hon. Wm. Pitt Fessenden, whose
term expired on the fourth of March, of that
year. Also an important resolution submitting
an amendment of a legal character to their consideration,
thus showing that his knowledge of
law was utilized by him as a law-maker.</p>

<p>As one of the chairmen of the State Prison
committee of the house he delivers a long
speech upon the 17th and 18th of March in reply
to one delivered by the same Hon. E. R.
Smart, who had opposed resolutions presented by
Mr. Blaine’s committee upon improving the present
prison and building another.</p>

<p>Mr. Smart was evidently the aggressor, and
very much his senior in age, but Mr. Blaine
sharply tells him that large portions of his
speech were irrelevant, having been delivered the
night before in a democratic meeting downtown;
calls him the Earl of Warwick to the
Democratic Plantagenets; compares him, with
great vigor, to a character in Gil Blas, who had
written a book in support of certain remedies
sure to cure, and which, though utterly futile,
he argued with a friend he must continue to
practice, because he had written the book, and
so Mr. Smart must inflict his speech because he
had written it.</p>

<p>Blaine was well-armed; had a wide array of
statistics; had, indeed, been over the ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
thoroughly the year before with the governor,
and written it up for his paper, and showed
himself competent to take care of his committee.</p>

<p>A short time before this he had made a
handsome little speech in favor of a resolve introduced
by this same leader of the Democracy,
in which he desired a new county formed, and
his own town of Camden made the shire-town,
and yet Mr. Blaine’s measure, a necessity, and
for the public good, is violently assailed.</p>

<p>A careful examination of the proceedings of
the legislature prove this to be a fact, that
Mr. Blaine was a devoted, constant, and faithful
member; that about every motion he made was
carried; and that he ranked in ability as a
speaker, both in matter and method, with the
best of them. His three years’ work as an
editor had made him well acquainted with its
members, and thoroughly conversant with the
ways of the house, so that he was thoroughly
at home in their midst, with none of the nervous
diffidence which a new member from the
country, however good and honest he might be,
would be very likely to have. He spoke about
as he wrote. He had written about five hundred
good, solid editorials in the previous years,
as they issued a tri-weekly during the session
of the legislature, and in reporting its doings
had caught the drift of its operations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>Moreover, he had a good business preparation
for his work. He had been largely upon his
own resources for ten years, and in the business
management of his paper, and in studying up
the business interests of the city and of the
state, he had acquired experience and knowledge.
No one, it would seem, can read the record of
his speeches, short and long, or the motions he
made, resolves he offered, without being impressed
that he had a clear, strong way of
looking at questions. He could tell the husk
from the corn at a glance, and if he had anything
to do with a member’s speech would tear
off the husk without any ceremony and make
quick search for the corn.</p>

<p>But the affairs of the country were in a bad
way as Mr. Blaine was daily recording them.
There had been over nine thousand business
failures in the country in 1857 and 1858; or, to
be exact, there were four thousand nine hundred
and thirty-two in 1857, and four thousand two
hundred and twenty-five in 1858, with a loss of
three hundred and eighty-seven million four hundred
and ninety-nine thousand six hundred and
sixty-two dollars, a sum in those days of enormous
proportion. Slave-holders, who had the
power then, were urging the purchase of Cuba,
at a cost of two hundred million dollars, for
the purposes of slavery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>The country seemed to be at a stand-still, or
going backwards. The state of Vermont had increased
in population but one thousand six hundred
and fifty-seven in ten years, from 1850 to
1860.</p>

<p>Senators Crittenden, of Kentucky, and Seward,
of New York, had a passage of words in the
senate, and apologized.</p>

<p>Fessenden had been re-elected to the United
States Senate, and New Hampshire had gone
Republican.</p>

<p>But Stephen A. Douglas had beaten Abraham
Lincoln for the senate from Illinois by a vote
of fifty-eight to forty-four, and Seward had introduced
his famous bill for the repression of
the slave trade, just to bring the Southern senators
into position on that subject, and this only
a year before Lincoln was nominated. It provided
for ten steamers, as a part of the navy,
to cruise along the coast of Africa, as the
president might direct.</p>

<p>About this time Oregon is admitted as the
second state on the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine deals with all the questions of the
day with skill and effectiveness. A municipal
election is going on in Portland, and Mr. Blaine
does his part by tongue and pen to aid in
achieving a Republican victory, which is triumphantly
accomplished just as the legislature is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
closing. But Mr. Blaine has time to deliver his
best speech of the session, on Friday before
final adjournment on Tuesday, April 5th, after a
session of ninety days. Now he has nearly nine
solid months of straight editorial work. The one
great object is ever prominent,—slavery must
go, or it must be restricted and kept out of
the territories. The country is in great commotion;
state after state fights out its battles and
wheels into line. In border states, especially,
political revolutions are taking place. The gospel
of Liberty is taking the place of the hard
political doctrines of pro-slavery Democracy. Mr.
Blaine has to fire at long range, so efficiently
has the work been done at home, but it is
cheering to see the beacons lighted along the
coast of Maine, and to know that the bonfires
are lighted all over the state. Men have already
been trained and gone forth to do yeoman service
in other states. The Washburns are in
Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, while Israel
Washburn, Jr., has just been elected governor
of the home state.</p>

<p>In 1860 Mr. Blaine is elected speaker of the
House, although his colleague, William T. Johnson,
of Augusta, was speaker the year before.
The singular popularity of the man is thus
demonstrated, as he takes the chair, escorted to
it by his defeated competitor; his words are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
few but in the best of taste. Mr. Blaine
said,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen of the House of Representatives</span>:</p>

<p>“I accept the position you assign me with a due
appreciation, I trust, of the honor it confers and
the responsibility it imposes. In presiding over your
deliberations it shall be my faithful endeavor to administer
the parliamentary rules in such manner that
the rights of minorities shall be protected, the constitutional
will of majorities enforced, and the common
weal effectively promoted. In this labor I am
sure I shall not look in vain for your forbearance as
well as your cordial co-operation. I am ready, gentlemen,
to proceed with the business of the House.”</p>
</div>

<p>He is in a position of power and influence
now; he is in the third office of the state.
His ability will be tested; great presence of
mind, quickness of decision, tact, and skill are
needful. But he is ready and at his ease. He
has the knowledge requisite, and experience
seems born of the man. He fits wherever placed.
He must know each member, and he knows
them; he must be just, and fair, and honorable,
and he is all of these by virtue of a broad,
generous nature.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine is speaker of the House of Representatives
of the state of Maine, not because
of any one good quality,—he is excelled in single
qualities by many another,—but because of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
large combination of good qualities, and these,
cultivated to a high degree. This it is that
wins; many a face is beautiful in some one or
more of its features, but so distorted in others
that the effect is bad, and beauty, which is the
harmonious blending of many lines upon the
canvas or features on the face, is lost. Character
is the restoration of moral order in the individual;
let this be broken by some defect,
omission, or failure, some secret or overt act,
and the harmony is lost, and a once fair character
is marred.</p>

<p>Thus it is not so much the symmetry as the
large and splendid combination of talents and
genius which make him what he is. He simply
does his best, and keeps himself at his best all
the time. He anticipates every occasion, and
has forces in reserve all the time, and they are
brought forward, if his tactics are not known, very
unexpectedly. The most telling points in all his
earlier speeches are not brought out at first,
and when they do appear you wonder why he did
not produce them before, and this very wonder
increases its power on you. This is rather a
necessity, it would seem, because there is point
and pith, and power all through.</p>

<p>A great year of destiny is before the nation;
a mighty, conquering battle-year. Slavery refuses
any concessions, and Liberty loves itself too well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
to be compromised. The great convention of
Republicans in the old wigwam in Chicago is an
event of so great importance that all minor
events dwindle before it. James G. Blaine is
there.</p>

<p>Excitement is at the highest pitch. The tone
and temper of the North is felt and feared.
The old Democratic party is shattered into fragments.
It has several wings, but no body. The
Union seems on the verge of dissolution. But
strong men, tried and true, who cannot be
brow-beaten and crushed; men who have not
been deceived or intimidated, or despoiled of
their convictions since the Whig party sold out
to Slavery in 1852; men who have waited eighteen
long, eventful years for the iron to get
hot enough to strike, are there; there in their
power; there, not to become demoralized, and
drop their guns and run, but to stand firm and
strong in a mighty phalanx, and do tremendous
battle for tremendous right against tremendous
wrong.</p>

<p>William H. Seward is the choice of men, but
Abraham Lincoln is the choice of God. He has
been fitting and training him for half a century,
much as he trained Moses, the great leader and
emancipator of his ancient people. They try in
vain to elect their man. The way is hedged
up; ballot after ballot is taken, but it cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
be done. Finally, the moment comes, and “honest
old Abe” is crowned by the hand of a remarkable
Providence, and God’s will is done.</p>

<p>Men shake their heads, but high yonder on
his throne the King does his thinking. All is
clear to him. Well-nigh a century of prayer
is to be answered.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine’s description of the sessions and
impressions at Chicago, make the great, inspiring
scenes live before the imagination, and show how
his broad, eager mind took it all in.</p>

<p>Ten of the Maine delegation were for Seward,
and six for Lincoln. A meeting was called, and
an effort made by the Seward men to win the
Lincoln delegates to their side. Wm. H. Evarts
was then in his prime, and was called in to make
the speech. He spoke for forty-five minutes, and
his speech, it was said, was “a string of pearls.”
Mr. Blaine stood just behind him, and though
greatly delighted with the beauty and brilliancy
of the address, remained a firm Lincoln man to
the end.</p>

<p>He had no vote then, but he had a voice and
a pen. From that time he was a great admirer
and friend of Mr. Evarts. This convention greatly
enlarged Mr. Blaine’s knowledge of men and acquaintance
with them.</p>

<p>The party in the four years since Frémont and
Dayton had been nominated at Philadelphia, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
the goading provocations of Buchanan’s administration,
the frequent exhibition of the horns
and hoofs of Slavery, and the unwearied agitation
in congress, and in every state, county, and town
of the North, the East, and the West, had made
a sturdy, constant, determined growth, a development
of back-bone, and a kindling of nerve that
imparted courage and sent joy to the heart.</p>

<p>It brought into the life of Mr. Blaine, more
than ever, the life and grandeur, the power and
greatness of the party to which he had wedded
his destiny, giving his hand and his heart. He
was in complete sympathy with every principle
and every measure. No man living more fully,
and clearly, and strongly, represents the ideas and
purposes of the men then at the front,—the leading
men to whom was entrusted the guidance
and responsibility, for he himself was then at the
front,—than does he.</p>

<p>He is, and has been, right through, the defender
and conservator of all that was dear, and
precious, and grand, then. Few men did more to
help elect Mr. Lincoln, or to make his administration
a power in the North. He was under fire
constantly, but then he was firing constantly himself,
and doing execution that told every hour for
the nation’s good.</p>

<p>The North was surely aroused as never before,
on fire with a great and mighty excitement that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
rolled in waves and billows from ocean to lake,
and lake to gulf. There was no general on the
side of Slavery that could command all the forces.
It had come to be in fact a house divided against
itself. Their convention at Charleston was broken
up, and Mr. Douglas nominated at Baltimore, and
two other candidates, Breckenridge and Bell, elsewhere.
The serpent seemed stinging itself to
death. But in the great party of the North
there is a solid front, no waver along the entire
line. They simply fight their great political battle
after the true American style of the Fathers,
in a most just and righteous manner, and for a
cause most just and righteous.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine was on the stump, as he had been
the year before, making speeches that the people
loved to hear. The campaign usually closed in
Maine in September, when the state officers were
elected, and as the convention in Chicago was
held in May, they had but three months to do
the work that other states did in five months.
Owing to the illness of his old friend and business
partner, he edited the <i>Kennebec Journal</i> for
five or six months during the summer and autumn
of 1860, so that he was back upon his old
ground during the great campaign, sitting at the
same desk.</p>

<p>The people loved him, and he loved them.
“Send us Blaine,” would come from all over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
state. “We must have him, we will have him.”
And he would go. It seemed as if he would go
farther, do more, and get back quicker than any
other man, and seemingly remember everybody.</p>

<p>Ex-Gov. Anson P. Morrill, his old political
friend and neighbor says, “I would go out and
address perhaps an acre of people, and be introduced
to a lot of them, and like enough, in six
months or a year, along would come a man and
say, ‘How are you? Don’t you know me?’ and
I would say ‘No,’ and then the man would turn
and go off; but Blaine would know him as soon
as he saw him coming, and say, ‘Hello,’ and call
him by name right off.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, and he laid his gold-bowed
spectacles on the table, and continued, “a little
better than a year ago he was in here, and we
sat at this table, and the spectacles laid there,
and he took them up and said, as he looked at
them closely, ‘If those are not the very same
gold-bowed spectacles you bought in Philadelphia
in 1856.’</p>

<p>“‘Why, how do you know?’ I asked in surprise.</p>

<p>“‘Why I was with you, and you bought them
at such a place on such a street.’</p>

<p>“And that,” said the governor, “was twenty-six
years before. Now did you ever hear of anything
like that? I didn’t. Why, I’d even forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
that he was there. I tell you that beat
me; and I asked him ‘what made you think of
it now?’</p>

<p>“‘O, I don’t know,’ said Mr. Blaine, ‘I just
happened to see them lying there, and thought
of it.’</p>

<p>“Well, it must be a good thing for you to remember
things that way.”</p>

<p>“And he simply replied, without any boasting,
or in a way to make his honored friend feel
that he felt his superior faculty in the least,—</p>

<p>“‘O, yes, it is, at times.’”</p>

<p>Gov. A. P. Morrill is a fine sample of a real
down-east Yankee, of the old style; a man of
sterling worth and integrity, and of the hardest
of common sense, and takes a special pride in
Mr. Blaine, as he was at one time of great assistance
to him in a political way.</p>

<p>“The first time I saw Blaine,” he said, “was
the night before my inauguration; he called at
my hotel and wanted a copy of my address. He
was simply a young man then, very pleasant in
his manner. But how he has grown. Yes, that
is the secret of it; he has been a growing man
ever since, and so he has come right up and
gone right along.”</p>

<p>His own re-election to the legislature is a minor
matter in the campaign of ’60, in comparison
with the election of Mr. Lincoln president.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
As this state votes earlier than many of the
others, the effort is to roll up a large majority,
and have great gains, so as to carry moral power
with it, and thus encourage other states who are
standing with them in the contest.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the position of parties
or presidential candidates at this time. Mr. Lincoln
would prohibit by law the extension of slavery.
This was exactly the position of the candidate
with him for vice-president, the Hon. Hannibal
Hamlin, a strong friend of Mr. Blaine.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin had originally been a Democrat of
the Andrew Jackson type, but when the Missouri
Compromise, which prohibited the extension
of slavery, was repealed, he entered the Republican
party at its formation, and as candidate
for governor in Maine in 1856, was a powerful
factor in breaking down the Democratic party.</p>

<p>Mr. Breckenridge would extend slavery by law,
and was of course the slave-holders candidate.
Douglas, the candidate of the Northern Democrats,
would not interfere; simply do nothing to
procure for slavery other portions of the fair
domain of Liberty to despoil. This, of course
made him unpopular in the South, where the
demand was for more states to conquer for our
“peculiar institution.” The cry of the Douglas
Democrats,—and they counted their wide-awakes
by the thousand, who marched with torch and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
drum,—“The Constitution as it is, and the
Union as it was.” The Bell and Everett faction
were simply for saving the Union without telling
how.</p>

<p>What a field these four great armies, each
with its chosen leader, occupied, and each conducting
a hot, fierce campaign, determined to
win, and determined to believe they would win.
Slavery was the great disturbing element. It
was all a question of how to deal with this
monster.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln was elected, and Blaine was again
on the winning side.</p>

<p>But Mr. Blaine had another great interest in
the political campaign of this year. A Mr.
Morse, of Bath, had been in congress from
another part of the third Maine district, in which
Augusta is located, and it was thought time for
a change, and Gov. A. P. Morrill wanted Blaine
to run, but Morse was a strong man and Blaine
was young, and a new man comparatively, and
though he was speaker of the House of Representatives,
he thought it not prudent at that
time to subject himself to such a test. “Fools
rush in where Angels fear to tread.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine was in a good position, and growing
rapidly, and so he urged the strong and
sagacious governor to try it himself, and Blaine
went into the campaign and helped achieve the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
victory,—for victory it was by seven thousand
majority.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine, it would seem, who possessed an
instinct for journalism so wonderful and fine,
possessed one equally well-developed for politics.
He well-knew that his rapid promotion would
awaken jealousies, prejudice, and envy, and also
that he needed and must have time to grow.
There was one at least in the state legislature
who had been in congress, and he did not wish
to “advance backward,” as the colored servant
of the rebel General Buckner called it.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine is a man of caution and carefulness,
because he is a man of great thoughtfulness and
deliberation. When he has thought a subject
through, and it is settled, and he feels just right,
he is ready, and his courage rises, and so he
moves with great power and determination. If
the action seems rash to any, it is because
they are not informed upon a subject upon which
he is conversant.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine had seen his man nominated at
Chicago, and triumphantly elected over a stupendous,
well-organized, and desperate opposition. He
himself is returned to the legislature. His friend,
Ex-Gov. A. P. Morrill, is secured for congress, and
Israel Washburn, Jr., a grand Republican, elected
governor over the man who felt and learned to
fear the power of Mr. Blaine in the legislature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
the year before, Ephraim K. Smart. But, notwithstanding
all of these triumphs, and the prospective
cleansing and regeneration of the country,
the present condition is most appalling.</p>

<p>Secession is the chief topic throughout the
South, and in every debating society in every
college, and in every lyceum in every town or
city, the question is being discussed with the
greatest warmth, “Can a Southern state secede?”
or “Can the government coerce a state?” The old
doctrine of state rights and state sovereignty is
the form of the topic in other quarters.</p>

<p>With many the question was clear on the asking
of it; with others the constitutional powers
of self-preservation, of self-existence, and self-perpetuation
had to be presented with the arguments
and the acumen of a statesman. Perhaps Mr.
Blaine, as an editor, never dealt with a question
in a more masterly way. It was the question
of the hour continually forcing itself upon attention.</p>

<p>It was the constant assertion of the Southern
press that they would. They believed all sorts
of unkind things about the great and kindly
Lincoln. The fact is, the South had never before
been defeated in a contest for the presidency
when slavery was involved in the issue.
This was their pet and idol. They would guard
it at all hazards. Fanaticism they regarded as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
the animus of the anti-slavery movement, and
an abolitionist to them was a malefactor.</p>

<p>A grave responsibility now was on those who
“broke down the adjustments of 1820, and of
1850.” But the year was closing, and the glare
of a contest more fierce than that through which
we had passed, was on the nation. It seemed
inevitable. They had grown so narrow, intolerant,
and cruel, that the light of present political
truth did not penetrate them.</p>

<p>“Southern statesmen of the highest rank,” said
Mr. Blaine, “looked upon British emancipation in
the West Indies as designedly hostile to the
prosperity and safety of their own section, and as
a plot for the ultimate destruction of the Republic.”
They were suspicious, and filled with
alarm; and it was needless, as the action of
Mr. Lincoln in proclaiming emancipation was
only when, in the second year of the war, it
was necessary.</p>

<p>The era of peace seems breaking with the
hand of cruel war. It was night to them, but a
glorious day to us.</p>

<p>We close this chapter with this fresh, new
poem of the time, by Whittier.</p>

<p>At a time when it was rumored that armed
men were drilling by the thousands in Virginia
and Maryland, for the invasion of Washington
before February, so as to prevent the announcement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
in congress of Lincoln’s election, in the
same issue of the <i>Kennebec Journal</i>, was a poem
by John G. Whittier, closing with these lines:—</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VIII.<br>

<small>SPEAKER OF THE MAINE LEGISLATURE.</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcn.jpg" width="75" height="76" alt="N">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">N</span>O one read the signs of the times with
a clearer understanding of their significance,
all through the winter and
spring of 1861, than the Speaker of
the House of Representatives in the Legislature
of Maine. The great duties that devolved upon
him filled his mind with every important matter,
but the overshadowing interests were all national,—the
present and future of the country.
They had become accustomed to threats and
fears; this had grown to be the normal condition
of the public mind. But the short, sharp
question “What is the latest from Charleston,
Richmond” and other points of prominence and
activity in the South, showed how squarely up
to the times people of the North were living;
how loyal and zealous for the nation the masses
were.</p>

<p>It was a higher compliment, in times so great
in their demands for the profoundest deliberations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
of the best minds, to be put at the head,
as the leader in positions of greatest power in
the House.</p>

<p>Known and acknowledged worth could have
been the only argument for an action so personal
to the honor of the state and its power
in the Union, and helpfulness to the nation in
an emergency imminent with danger.</p>

<p>This man of one and thirty is lifted over the
heads of old and respected citizens of soundest
integrity. Is it an experiment, or do they know
their man? The state has called to the helm a
man who has been ten years in the congress of
the United States; a man of largest experience
and profoundest wisdom, nearly twice the age
of the young speaker. But no mistake is made.
He read in his youth books that Governor Morrill
is reading to-day at the age of eighty-one;
he has been a college-graduate for nearly fourteen
years, and has won his present distinction
upon the floor of the house where he now presides.</p>

<p>His duties are manifold. He must preside
over the deliberations of the House, be a good
parliamentarian, prompt and accurate in his decisions,
as well as fair and impartial. He is
dealing with freemen and citizens, and representatives
of the people of the entire state. He
must know every member, not by name, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
face, and location in the House, but in characteristics
and accomplishments, all the great interests
of the state, as a whole, of its different
sections, and in its Federal relations, so that he
may wisely appoint the twenty-one important
committees. He must know the business, education,
experience, residence, and political principles
of every member, so that he may know just
who to appoint on banks and banking, on agriculture,
military, pensions, manufactures, library,
the judiciary, the militia, education, etc.</p>

<p>There are one hundred and forty-four members,
twenty-three of whom are Democrats, and he
must use them all. He must select two chairmen
for each committee, and choose six or eight
others to act with them, putting some of the
more valuable men on several committees,—all
must be treated with honor and fairness.</p>

<p>What did those one hundred and forty-four
men see in James G. Blaine, away back in the
stormy, perilous times of 1861, that led them to
select him for that high and honorable position?
He had not been a citizen of Maine six years,
and had been in political life, officially, only
two years. It was the man they saw, strong and
splendid, just the man for the hour. They felt,
instinctively, they could trust him; they knew
him to be loyal and true, and capable, by the
testimony of all their senses. He was quick and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
keen, and life itself in all of energy and endeavor;
a born leader of men.</p>

<p>He had no wealthy and influential friend by
his side, no one to say I have known him from
childhood, and can recommend him as worthy
of all honor, and all praise. He brought with
him simply the name his mother gave him, with
no prefix and no affix. He lived in no mansion,
rode in no carriage, was attended by no courtiers
in livery; he had no returns to make, no
promises to give. The whole of him sat before
them,—a refined and courteous gentleman, an
elegant gentleman.</p>

<p>They could not mistake the powerful combination.
They saw and felt its worth, and so the
great party which had just come into power in
the nation by electing its first president, honors
itself by honoring him.</p>

<p>His short-cut words of acceptance are uttered.
The senate and the new governor, Israel Washburn,
Jr., are informed that the House is organized,
and they proceed to business with energy
and despatch.</p>

<p>But the great war for the Union is coming.
The peace convention called by Virginia amounts
to nothing. Mr. Crittenden’s resolutions are
futile, though most conventions adopt them in
Philadelphia and elsewhere. Southern states are
actually seceding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>Mr. Lincoln is choosing and announcing his
cabinet, with Seward as his Premier, but treason
is rampant in the South, holding high carnival
in state capitals, and even in the halls of congress.
Mr. Lincoln is on his way to Washington.
He reaches Philadelphia on Feb. 22d, at
seven o’clock; is escorted to Independence Hall,
where Theodore Cuyler, in whose office Mr.
Blaine read law, receives him with an address
of welcome, to which Mr. Lincoln replied, and
“raised the national flag which had been adjusted
in true man-of-war style, amid the cheers
of a great multitude, and the cheers were repeated
until men were hoarse.”</p>

<p>While these patriotic cheers were resounding
through the old halls of Independence, the
traitorous secretaries of the navy and of war
were sending vessels to southern ports and forts.
Thirty-three officers, among whom was Albert
Sidney Johnson, abandon their regiments of the
regular army in Texas, and join the rebels. But
Lincoln is inaugurated, and the most pacific
measures employed, but all of no avail; determined,
desperate men are ruling the destiny of
the South.</p>

<p>The South was in no condition of want at
this time, but rather in a condition of prosperity,
and its proud, haughty spirit seemed
rather born of luxury and extravagance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>Mr. Blaine has shown that she had increased
in ten years before the war three thousand millions
of dollars, and this not from over-valuation
of slaves, but from cultivation of the land by
new and valuable appliances of agriculture. One
state alone,—Georgia,—had increased in wealth
three hundred millions of dollars. But South
Carolina had commenced in October,—before Mr.
Lincoln’s election even,—her correspondence upon
the subject of secession. No wonder she was
ready in the April following to inaugurate the
war of the Rebellion.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine’s life could not be put into the
nation, nor the life of any strong, true man,
at a time when it would be more valuable than
now. Men were men in earnest. They rose to
par, and some, by a mathematical process which
redoubles energy and intensifies life, are cubed
or squared or lifted to the hundredth power; a
premium is on them; they are invaluable.</p>

<p>The governor issues his call for ten thousand
men from Maine. Will Mr. Blaine go? Mr.
Garfield is in the state senate of Ohio, and
president of a college, but he drops all at once,
and is soon at the front with his regiment.
His stay is short, however. Elected to congress,
by advice of President Lincoln he lays aside
the dress of a major-general on Saturday to
enter the national House of Representatives, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
congressman in citizen’s dress, the following
Monday.</p>

<p>What will Mr. Blaine do? He is speaker of
the House, and that gives his name a power in
the state. He is wielding a powerful pen as
editor of the leading daily paper at Portland.
Few men in the state have more influence;
some must stay; the state must be aroused and
electrified; an immense work of organization is
to be done. It is a less conspicuous, more
quiet home-work, but it is of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>He stays, while many, like Garfield, go
to return to do the statesman’s work and make
available the resources of the nation, and
strengthen the hands of the brave men at the
front.</p>

<p>This was a work of vast importance in the
conduct of the war. It was power that was felt
by both governor and president, by army and
navy. Mr. Blaine was on terms of intimacy with
the governor of his state,—a firm supporter of
a faithful man. Very soon he was instrumental
in raising two regiments, and rallied thousands
more to the standard of the Union.</p>

<p>He became at this time chairman of the Republican
State Central Committee, and continued
in this position for twenty years. He planned
every campaign, selected the speakers, fixed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
dates and places for them, and so arranged all
details, that no man of his ever disappointed an
audience. He knows the time of departure and
arrival of every train. He must do his part to
see that the legislature continues Republican,
that the governor and his council are Republican,
that congressmen and senators of the
United States are Republican, and that the war-power
of the state is not broken.</p>

<p>The great question for him to aid largely in
settling is the worth of the state of Maine to
the nation. She must have governors that are
in full sympathy with the president; congressmen
and senators that uphold his administration.</p>

<p>In North’s History of Augusta, a valuable
work of nearly a thousand pages, it is recorded
of Mr. Blaine that “probably no man in Maine
exerted a more powerful influence on the
patriotic course pursued than he. Ever active,
always watchful, never faltering, he inspired confidence
in the cause of the Union in its darkest
days.”</p>

<p>At the close of the first session of the legislature
over which Mr. Blaine presided, the leading
Democrat in the House, a Mr. Gould, from
Thomaston, arose after remarks of great pathos
and tenderness, and presented this resolution:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the thanks of this House are presented
to the Hon. James G. Blaine, for the marked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
ability, the urbanity and impartiality with which he
has presided over its deliberations, and for the uniform
amenity of his personal intercourse with its
members.”</p>
</div>

<p>He bore testimony to the “marvelous despatch
with which the formal parts of the business
had been done, and so the session greatly
shortened.”</p>

<p>The resolution was adopted by a unanimous
vote, and Mr. Blaine said,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen of the House of Representatives</span>:</p>

<p>“You will accept my most grateful acknowledgments
for the very cordial manner in which you have signified
your approbation of my course as your presiding
officer. I beg in return to witness to the dignity, the
diligence, and the ability with which you have severally
discharged your representative trusts. We met,
many of us, as strangers; may I not hope that we
all part as friends, and parting, may we bear to our
homes the recollection of duties faithfully performed,
and the consciousness of having done something to
promote the prosperity and welfare of our honored
state. I bid you farewell.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was on the 18th of March, and on the
22d of April, the war having broken out, they
were assembled again in extra session, Mr. Blaine
in the chair. In three days and a half provisions
were made for raising troops and money for
the war, and legislation pertaining to militia-laws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
was enacted, etc. The wildest rumors filled the
air. The country seemed transformed at once into
a turbulent sea, but men did not lose their reckoning.
Latitude and longitude were things too
deeply fixed and broadly marked to be unseen or
ignored. The storm blew from a single quarter.
Its long gathering had made it black and fierce.
It struck the gallant ship of state. She was reeling
with the shock of war.</p>

<p>Never did the beauty and worth of federal
states appear to better advantage than when the
impoverished and plundered government called on
them for aid. It was the parent’s call upon her
children for defence against their own misguided
sisters. Never was mechanism more finely adjusted,
or power more equally balanced, than in the
Republic. Very distinct and separate are head
and feet and hands, eyes and ears, yet nothing
is more perfect in its unity.</p>

<p>It is much the same with the great union of
states. They are separated far, and quite distinct
in varied interests, but one in powerful unity.
But the time had come to show the strength of
that unity. All there was of the great mind and
heart and life of Mr. Blaine was given to the
nation in holiest exercise of all his powers.</p>

<p>While eighty thousand of the foe are opposing
thirty-five thousand of our troops at Manassas
Junction, and Colonel Ellsworth is losing his life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
at Alexandria; while Stephen A. Douglas is delivering
in early June his last eloquent words,
straight and heroic for the nation; while the
bankers of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia
are casting one hundred and fifty millions of dollars
into the national treasury at Washington,
and the brave General Lyon with eight thousand
men is routing twenty-three thousand of the enemy
in Missouri, at the cost of his life,—while
all the activities of that first summer of war are
going on, Mr. Blaine is facing a political storm
of great severity, as general-in-chief in the campaign
that places Israel Washburn, Jr., again in
the gubernatorial chair of the state, and keeps
the reins of government in Republican hands.</p>

<p>It has been a question often debated whether
the nation is most indebted to her warriors or
her statesmen. There can be no hesitation in
deciding, where the mere question of life is considered,
or the hardships of camp and march and
field are included in the account. And yet Lincoln,
nor Garfield wore a uniform when the bullet
struck.</p>

<p>No one thinks their patriotism less intense, or
that of cabinet, or senators and members of the
house, or governors and council, or members of
legislatures less ardent in their love of country,
and zeal for the honor of her imperilled cause.
At such times all true hearts are one, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
blood that throbs in hands and heart and feet
is all the same.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine was re-elected to his accustomed
place in the legislature of the state. The terrific
war rages on. The demand for troops increases,—is
indeed quadrupled,—and the state
must be brought up to her quota by methods
the wisest and best. And again and again the
clarion voice of the speaker of the House rings
over the state with no uncertain sound. Companies
and regiments are formed, and these must
be filled. The fires burning so brightly, must
burn brighter. Intense love must be intensified.
The news of terrible battles thrills over the state
almost daily. The romance of war is over. Its
gilt edge is gone. It is hard, desperate, bloody
work. Their sons and brothers and fathers are
falling by the score and hundred at the front.
The bloody work has been done at Ball’s Bluff
and Port Royal. Sons of Maine are in Libby
Prison and at Belle Isle.</p>

<p>The hard, serious question is discussed in every
home. It fills the dreams of yeomanry,—“Shall
I go?” “Can I go?” All that is sacred
in business and religion in home and country is
the question. Men are lifted by appeals almost
divine in eloquence, above any petty consideration,
to the grave question of the nation’s life
and destiny. Their names go down by scores<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
and hundreds. Regiments and brigades seem
born in a day. They come from all ranks and
conditions,—from pulpit and press, from farm and
shop, from bank and office, and store and halls
of state,—and are transformed in an hour from
citizens to soldiers, and march away to the front.
Steamer and car swarm with them.</p>

<p>The music dies away down the river, and they
are gone,—gone perhaps forever. Good-byes are
cherished in heart of hearts, and kisses from
mother, father, lover, friend, are carried away like
cameos of thought, the sacred things of memory.</p>

<p>In the autumn we find Mr. Blaine in Washington,
probably for the first time, but not in
official relations to the government. He must
have a nearer view of the great scenes being
enacted. He must know the men who are wielding
the nation’s power, and put his finger on the
pulse of war, and gather material for the more
intense activity his work at home assumes. He
must see the great-hearted Lincoln, and shake
his hand, and give him cheer.</p>

<p>Fessenden, Hamlin, and Morrill are there, for
congress is in session in a city fortified, and its
streets patrolled by soldiers. Andrew Johnson is
the only senator present from eleven seceded
states. Breckenridge, mortified by the vote of his
state, and the rebuke and the castigation the
dead Douglas had given him in the early spring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
was present from Kentucky; and Lane and Pomeroy
were in their seats from the new, free
state of Kansas, as her first senators. And the
two Union senators were there,—Messrs. Willy
and Carlisle,—from the western portion of seceded
Virginia. Only five free states had other
than Republican senators. Bright, Breckenridge,
and Polk were expelled.</p>

<p>Chase, and Cameron, and Seward had entered
the cabinet, but an impressive array of talent remained
in the senate, to be studied by our rising
young statesman to best advantage. Charles
Sumner and Henry Wilson were there from Massachusetts;
Zachariah Chandler, and Bingham, of
Michigan; Wilkinson of Minnesota; John P. Hale
and Daniel Clark, of New Hampshire; Benjamin
F. Wade and John Sherman, of Ohio; Wilmot
and Cowan, of Pennsylvania; James R. Doolittle
and Timothy O. Hone, of Wisconsin. Jacob Collamore,
formerly in General Taylor’s cabinet, a
ripe, scholarly man, was a senator from Vermont,
and Simmons and Anthony, from Rhode Island.</p>

<p>On his first visit to the National Capital, Mr.
Blaine could not fail to visit the House where
he himself was destined to have a career so famous
and honorable alike to himself, his state,
and the nation. There was his friend, Anson P.
Morrill, who had desired him to take the nomination
to congress the present session, rather than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
himself, and Galusha A. Grow, from his native
state, a member of the convention which has just
nominated him for the presidency, and of the
committee notifying of the same, was then in the
chair to be reserved for him as speaker of that
house. Thaddeus Stevens, fearless, able, of intrepid
spirit and strong character, the best hater
of slavery on the continent, hating even those
who did not hate it, was the natural leader of the
House, assuming his place by common consent.
He attracted Mr. Blaine’s special attention.</p>

<p>John Hickman and Edward McPherson were
with him from Pennsylvania; and from New York
there were Reuben E. Fenton, experienced and
strong in public affairs, Elbridge G. Spaulding,
the financier, William A. Wheeler, since vice-president,
secretary Seward’s friend and confidant,
Theodore Pomeroy.</p>

<p>“The ablest and most brilliant man of the delegation,”
says Mr. Blaine, “was Roscoe Conkling.
He had been elected to the preceding congress
when but twenty-nine years of age, and had exhibited
a readiness and elegance in debate that
placed him at once in the front rank. His command
of language was remarkable. In affluent
and exhuberant diction Mr. Conkling was never
surpassed in either branch of congress, unless,
perhaps, by Rufus Choate.”</p>

<p>Massachusetts had a strong delegation, headed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
by Henry L. Dawes, and with him were A. H.
Rice, since governor of the state, Elliott, Alley,
and William Appleton. Missouri sent Blair and
Rollins, from the battle-field. Crittenden, who had
been six times elected to the senate, in two cabinets,
appointed to the supreme bench, was then
in the house, seeking with Charles A. Wickliffe,
to save Kentucky to the Union, against the treasonable
conspiracies of Breckenridge. With Crittenden
and Wickliffe strong for the Union, were
Robert Mallory, James S. Jackson, and William
H. Wadsworth, keeping up the almost even balance
of power in their state. Gilman Marston
was there from New Hampshire, soon to become
conspicuous in the field. Justin S. Morrill from
Vermont, Frederick A. Pike, and the brother of
senator Fessenden from Maine, in company with
Ex-Gov. Anson P. Morrill. Illinois, Ohio, and Indiana
had strong men there also, as did Iowa
and Minnesota.</p>

<p>Elihu B. Washburn, Owen Lovejoy, William A.
Richardson, and John A. Logan, represented the
state of Lincoln and Grant; Schuyler Colfax,
George W. Julian, Albert G. Porter, Wm. McKee
Dunn, and Daniel W. Voorhees, were there from
Indiana; and from the state of Garfield, Bingham,
Shellabarger, Horton, and Ashley. Pendleton,
Vallandigham, and S. S. Cox were on the
Democratic side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>It must have been the dawn of an era of new
inspirations and of fresh aspirations, to look in
upon such a body of men, only a few of the
leaders of whom we have mentioned.</p>

<p>Anson P. Morrill had written him, six months
before he let anyone else into the secret, that
he should not run again for congress. His business
required his attention, having extensive
woolen mills some twelve miles from Augusta,
and he did not enjoy life at Washington, and
away from home.</p>

<p>He desired Mr. Blaine, as he had before desired,
to take his place, and hence gave him a
note of warning, and special opportunity for preparation.
This surely betokened Mr. Merrill’s
large confidence in Mr. Blaine, which is certainly
remarkable, when we remember that Mr. Blaine
was twenty-seven years younger than Mr. Morrill,
who was then in his prime, about sixty years
of age; and yet he looks down upon a young
man of thirty-one, and asks him to come up and
take his place in the councils of the nation.
Why this confidence, this unquestioned assurance
of power, this high compliment of age and experience,
of wealth, and extraordinary business
ability of the old governor of Maine to the young
and dauntless Speaker of the House at home?</p>

<p>First of all, because he had abundantly found
him as speaker of the House winning golden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
opinions from those over whose deliberations he
had presided.</p>

<p>Second, because he had just conducted, as
chairman of the State Central Committee of the
Republican party, a campaign, re-electing Governor
Washburn, and himself to the legislature, and
thus fighting unto victory the home-battle of
the Union, meanwhile pushing hard and successfully
the editorial work of the <i>Daily Advertiser</i>
at Portland.</p>

<p>But more than either of these events or considerations,
the presidential campaign of 1860
had endeared him to Mr. Morrill. Then he had
stumped the state with the Hon. Anson Burlingame
of Massachusetts,—he discussing the state
issues while Mr. Burlingame discussed the national
issues.</p>

<p>An old citizen high in state office to-day, who
heard him frequently, says “he won the people
by the skill and comprehensiveness with which
he analyzed and argued the great questions of
the time.”</p>

<p>He also said “that his editorials in the
<i>Journal</i> of that summer and autumn, when Mr.
Stevens, his old partner, was sick, furnished all
the material for the campaign.” He gathered up
and crowded in all there was.</p>

<p>It was that total exemption from indolence,
his marked degree of energy, and priceless abilities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
that charmed the old governor and warmed
his great heart toward him. And then it was
upon that same tidal wave of influence, sweeping
out from the depths of that fresh, young
life, that Mr. Morrill himself was swept into his
seat in congress.</p>

<p>The Democrats had up for governor their
strong man that year, Ephraim K. Smart, who
had been several terms in congress, and made
the biggest possible fight that lay in their power,
but all to no purpose. The speeches of Mr.
Blaine fixed the attention of the state upon him,
as coming from a man away beyond his years.
He could, we are told, “marshal statistics with
great facility”; facts, figures, faces, he knew
them all, and impressed the people, even the
old campaigners, with a boundlessness of political
and historical knowledge that is distinctly remembered
to this day.</p>

<p>They have gotten use to this sort of thing
up in Maine, and talk like men who reached
their conclusions years ago. Their minds were
made up as to the man in Augusta, at least
over a quarter of a century ago, away back in
1856, some of them when, fresh from the Philadelphia
convention, he made his Frémont and
Dayton speech, twenty-eight years ago, and he
has simply been expanding, and enlarging, filling
up, and growing ever since. He has been watched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
with eager pride and rejoiced in with the devotion
of brothers and friends, as wave after wave
of his majestic influence has dashed across the
boundary lines of the state, and broken over the
nation.</p>

<p>It would have been something unaccountable
if every round of the ladder had not been
touched at last by him, and yet there is no
fatality about it. He was no child of destiny,
but of industry; no creature of chance, but of
choice; not of luck, but of pluck; not of fortune,
but of fortitude; not of circumstance, but
of courage and consecrated energy.</p>

<p>He returned home from his first view of
Washington with larger views of the nation’s
greatness, and the fierceness of the contests
that were testing her strength, and a holier
ambition to make every power tell for Liberty’s
victory, and the nation’s emancipation from
wrong, and her projection upon a loftier career
of service among the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>The state could not hold him long after the
revelation of these few brief days and weeks.
But he could wait his time, meanwhile reorganizing
all the forces at his command for victory
of a larger kind, and in a larger field than had
fallen to his lot. And why not? He was fast
outgrowing the places filled thus far, and others
were opening to him without the asking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>The plans for the new year are all laid before
the old year dies. Then he shall stand
nearer the seat of war; then he shall study
questions and characters, plans and persons, opinions,
policies, and principles, all the great states
and machinery of government. His home shall
be in the great city and centre of the land,
where authority, wisdom, and power reside, and
where no excellence but is in demand, no great,
shining quality but shall shine amid a thousand
reflections, and name and place shall but increase
each power to serve and save the nation’s life.</p>

<small>SECOND TERM AS SPEAKER.</small></h2>
</div>
<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dco.jpg" width="75" height="74" alt="O">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">O</span>N Jan. 1, 1862, Mr. Blaine was re-nominated
by acclamation, and re-elected by
an almost unanimous vote, Speaker of
the Maine House of Representatives.
The war was enlarging the demand for legislation.
All great national issues must be discussed
by the state legislatures, and the demand for
their adoption sprung from the people, a knowledge
of whose will could be best gained in this
way. Resolutions were discussed as regards confiscating
the slaves, and arming them in the nation’s
defence, and so the representatives in congress
were instructed and encouraged, and their
actions brought up as legislative measures and
endorsed.</p>

<p>Grave suspicions existed at this time in the
minds of many in the state of Maine, in view
of the attitude of the British nation towards the
United States, and the feeling of a portion of
the British people, as developed by the Mason
and Slidell affair, and the blockade-runners fitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
out in British ports. The exposed condition
of the coast and boundary line of Maine, had
caused national alarm upon this subject to center
largely in the state.</p>

<p>“For more than four hundred miles,” said the
governor, Israel Washburn, Jr., in his inaugural
address of January, 1862, “this state is separated
from the British Provinces of New Brunswick
and Canada by a merely imaginary line.
Of the deep and bitter hostility to this country
of large numbers of the people, we have now,
unhappily,” he goes on to say, “the most indubitable
proofs.</p>

<p>“Upon the coast of Maine there are more
deep, accessible harbors, capable of being entered
by the largest ships of war, than can be found on
the entire coast-line of the slave-holding states;
and yet since she entered the federal Union in
1820, less than half has been expended for
her coast protection and improvement than was
expended within ten years for the building of
a custom-house in the single city of Charleston.”</p>

<p>The old adage, “In time of peace prepare for
war,” had not been followed, and now commissioners
are sent to Washington to present the
facts regarding Maine’s defenseless condition, and
the engineer department was directed, by order
of Simon Cameron, Secretary of War, to send a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
competent officer to examine and report upon the
subject.</p>

<p>This is one of the topics filling the mind of
Maine statesmen of this time, and its importance
is so presented and impressed, that on Jan. 17,
one hundred thousand dollars was appropriated
for Fort Knox on the Penobscot River, Maine,
one hundred thousand dollars for the fort on Hog
Island, Portland Harbor, and fifty thousand dollars
each for these two forts the following
year.</p>

<p>Seldom were there so many bills of great importance
to the state and nation before the legislature,
as at this and subsequent sessions. But
most of the time the speaker sat quietly in his
chair, exercising the functions of his office. Men
seemed to be growing into greatness at a single
session; speeches of great effectiveness, and eloquent
with patriotic ardor, came to be a daily
occurrence.</p>

<p>Union victories began to cheer the nation. General
Thomas at Mill Springs, Ky., had fought and
won a glorious day. Forts Henry and Donelson
had fallen, and hordes of rebels had surrendered.
Nashville was occupied by Union troops, and Andrew
Johnson was appointed governor of Tennessee.
Indeed, he was descending the steps of the
Capitol at Washington with a bevy of his friends,
and just starting for the capital of Tennessee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
the very afternoon of March 7th, to which we
are about to call special attention.</p>

<p>No scene more brilliant graces the early history
of Mr. Blaine, than his reply to Hon. A.
P. Gould, a distinguished lawyer of Thomaston,
and a member of the lower House, in vindication
of the war-power of congress. The hearty
support of every Northern state was a necessity.</p>

<p>The following resolutions were passed by the
Senate of Maine, on the 7th of February, 1862,
by yeas twenty-four, nays four:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“STATE OF MAINE.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">“RESOLUTIONS RELATING TO NATIONAL AFFAIRS.</span></p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That we cordially endorse the administration
of Abraham Lincoln in the conduct of the war
against the wicked and unnatural enemies of the Republic,
and that in all its measures calculated to
crush this rebellion speedily and finally, the administration
is entitled to and will receive the unwavering
support of the loyal people of Maine.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That it is the duty of congress, by such
means as will not jeopardize the rights and safety of
the loyal people of the South, to provide for the
confiscation of estates, real and personal, of rebels,
and for the forfeiture and liberation of every slave
claimed by any person who shall continue in arms
against the authority of the United States, or who
shall in any manner aid and abet the present wicked
and unjustifiable rebellion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“<i>Resolved</i>, That in this perilous crisis of the country,
it is the duty of congress, in the exercise of its
constitutional power, to ‘raise and support armies,’
to provide by law for accepting the services of all
able-bodied men of whatever status, and to employ
these men in such manner as military necessity and
the safety of the Republic may demand.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That a copy of these resolutions be sent
to the senators and representatives in congress from
this state, and that they be respectfully requested to
use all honorable means to secure the passage of
acts embodying their spirit and substance.”</p>
</div>

<p>The resolutions were sent to the House for
concurrence, and were there referred to the
committee of the whole. On the 6th and 7th
of March, Mr. Gould, of Thomaston, made an
elaborate argument against them. At the conclusion
of his remarks he was replied to by
Mr. Blaine, Speaker of the House. The resolutions
were subsequently adopted by the House
in concurrence with the Senate, by yeas one
hundred and four, nays twenty-six.</p>

<p>Mr. Gould had spoken for seven hours against
the resolutions. The House had gone into committee
of the whole, with Mr. Frye, the present
United States senator, in the chair. The senate
was present in a body, on one side, the
governor and his council on the other, and as
many as could enter, filled the galleries and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
vacant spaces, when Mr. Blaine, then but thirty-two
years of age, took up the gage of battle,
and spoke for two hours, and so utterly demolished
the premises and conclusions of his
powerful antagonist as to carry the resolution
through the House with but few dissenting
voices.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine had been re-elected Speaker of the
House by a vote of one hundred and thirty-five
out of one hundred and forty, at the present
session. All eyes were turned to him as the
man for the occasion.</p>

<p>His old paper, the <i>Kennebec Journal</i>, with
which he had had no official connection for
three years, says of the speech:—</p>

<p>“Never, in the legislative history of Maine,
has there been such an opportunity for a forensic
effort as was presented in the House of
Representatives on Friday afternoon, at the close
of the seven hours’ speech of Hon. A. P. Gould
on the national resolutions. The expectation of
the legislature was that Hon. James G. Blaine
would speak in defense of the principles and the
measures by which the Federal government will
be able to crush the Rebellion and restore the
Republic to that true and certain basis on which
it was originally established. Mr. Blaine’s speech
occupied two hours, and was fully equal to the
anticipations of the unconditional friends of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
government. From beginning to close it was
crowded with arguments and salient facts, interspersed
with due proportion of wit, satire, invective
and telling hits against the doctrines and
positions of his opponent. It showed, with great
clearness and strength, that the power of confiscating
the slaves of rebels belongs to congress,
and to no other power. It adhered firmly
to the long-recognized principle that <i>the safety
of the Republic is the supreme law</i>, before which
every pecuniary interest must give way, and advancing
in this broad highway, so clearly defined
by the highest authorities of international law,
and so luminous with the best light of history,
the speaker made a complete overthrow of the
sophistry and disloyalty of those who plead the
defences of the constitution for the security of
traitors, as against the necessities of the Republic.
The speech was brilliantly eloquent, conclusive
in argument, and in all essential particulars
was a success which cannot fail to add to the
reputation of the author.”</p>

<p>We give some extracts from the speech of
Mr. Blaine:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The first hour of the seven which the gentleman
from Thomaston has consumed I shall pass over
with scarcely a comment. It was addressed almost
exclusively, and in violation of parliamentary rules, to
personal matters between himself and a distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
citizen from the same section, lately the gubernatorial
candidate of the Democratic party, and now representing
the county of Knox in the other branch of the
legislature....</p>

<p>“I shall best make myself understood, and perhaps
most intelligibly respond to the argument of the
gentleman from Thomaston, by discussing the question
in its two phases: <i>first</i>, as to the power of
congress to adopt the measures conceived in the
pending resolutions; and, <i>secondly</i>, as to the expediency
of adopting them. And, at the very outset, I
find between the gentleman from Thomaston and myself
a most radical difference as to the ‘war-power’
of the constitution; its origin, its extent, and the
authority which shall determine its actions, direct its
operation, and fix its limit. He contends, and he
spent some four or five hours in attempting to prove,
that the war-power in this Government is lodged
wholly in the executive, and in describing his almost
endless authority, he piled Ossa on Pelion until he
had made the president, under the war-power, perfectly
despotic, with all prerogatives and privileges
concentrated in his own person, and then to end the
tragedy with a farce, with uplifted hands he reverently
thanked God that Abraham Lincoln was not
an ambitious villain (like some of his Democratic
predecessors, I presume), to use this power, trample
on the liberties of the nation, erect a throne for
himself, and thus add another to the list of usurpers
that have disfigured the world’s history.</p>

<p>“I dissent from these conclusions of the gentleman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
I read the Federal constitution differently. I read in
the most frequent and suggestive section of that immortal
chart, that certain ‘powers’ are declared to
belong to congress. I read therein that ‘congress
shall have power’ among other large grants of
authority, ‘to provide for the common defence’; that
it shall have power ‘to declare war, grant letters of
marque and reprisal, and make rules concerning captures
on land and water’; that it shall have power
‘to raise and support armies’; to ‘provide and
maintain a navy’; and ‘to make rules for the government
of the land and naval forces.’ And as
though these were not sufficiently broad and general,
the section concludes in its eighteenth subdivision by
declaring that congress shall have power ‘to make
all laws which shall be necessary and proper for
carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all
other powers vested by this constitution in the Government
of the United States, or in any department
or officer thereof.’ Mark that,—‘in any department
or officer thereof!’...</p>

<p>“At the origin of our government, Mr. Chairman,
the people were jealous of their liberties; they gave
power guardedly and grudgingly to their rulers; they
were hostile above all things to what is termed the
<i>one-man</i> power; and you cannot but observe with
what peculiar care they provided against the abuse
of the ‘war-power.’ For, after giving to congress
the power ‘to declare war,’ and ‘to raise and support
armies,’ they added in the constitution these
remarkable and emphatic words,—‘<i>but no appropriation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
of money to that use shall be for a longer term
than two years</i>,’ which is precisely the period for
which the representatives in the popular branch are
chosen. Thus, sir, this power was not given to congress
simply, but in effect it was given to the house
of representatives; the people placing it where they
could lay their hands directly upon it at every biennial
election, and say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the principle
or policy of any war....</p>

<p>“The other point at issue has reference to the
relations that now exist between the Government of
the United States and the so-called Confederate
States. The gentleman from Thomaston has quoted
the treason clause of the constitution, and has elaborately
argued that the armed rebels in the South
have still the full right to the protection of property
guaranteed therein, and that any confiscation of their
property or estates by any other process than is
there laid down would be unconstitutional. I am
endeavoring to state the position of the gentleman
with entire candor, as I desire to meet his argument
throughout in that spirit. I maintain, sir, in opposition
to this view, that we derive the right to confiscate
the property and liberate the slaves of rebels
from a totally different source. I maintain that to-day
we are in a state of civil war,—civil war, too, of the
most gigantic proportions. And I think it will strike
this House as a singular and most significant confession
of the unsoundness of the gentleman’s argument,
that to sustain his positions, he had to deny that
we are engaged in civil war at all. He stated, much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
to the amusement of the House, I think, that it was
not a civil war because Jeff. Davis was not seeking to
wrest the presidential chair from Abraham Lincoln,
but simply to carry off a portion of the Union, in
order to form a separate government. Pray, sir, is
not Abraham Lincoln the rightful president of the whole
country and of all the states, and is it not interfering
as much with his constitutional prerogative to dispute
his authority in Georgia or Louisiana as it would be
to dispute it in Maine or Pennsylvania?</p>

<p>“To assume the ground of the gentleman from
Thomaston, with its legitimate sequences, is practically
to give up the contest. Yet he tells you, and
he certainly repeated it a score of times, that you
cannot deprive these rebels of their property, except
‘by due process of law,’ and at the same time he
confesses that within the rebel territory it is impossible
to serve any precept or enforce any verdict. He at
the same time declares that we have not belligerent
rights because the contest is not a civil war. Pray,
what kind of a war is it? The gentleman acknowledges
that the rebels are traitors, and if so, that
they must be engaged in some kind of war, because
the constitution declares that ‘treason against the
United States shall consist only in levying war
against them.’ It is therefore war on their side. It
must also be war on ours, and if so, what kind of
war?”</p>

<p>[Mr. Gould rose and said that he would define it
as domestic war.]</p>

<p>[Mr. Blaine, resuming.] “Domestic war! That’s it!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
Well, Mr. Chairman, we shall learn something before
this discussion is over. Domestic war! I have heard
of domestic woolens, domestic sheetings, and domestic
felicity, but a ‘domestic war’ is something entirely
new under the sun. All the writers of international
law that I have ever read, speak of two kinds of war,—foreign
and civil. Vattel will, I suppose, have a new
edition, with annotations by Gould, in which ‘domestic
war’ will be defined and illustrated as a contest
not quite foreign, not quite civil, but one in which
the rebellious party has at one and the same time
all the rights of peaceful citizens and all the immunities
of alien enemies—for that is precisely what
the gentleman by his argument claims for the
Southern secessionists.”</p>
</div>

<p>The stormy and brilliant session was drawing
to a close. The speaker had achieved the great
triumph of the winter. Others had made grand
and effective speeches. It could scarcely be otherwise.
Soldiers were encamped about the city;
camp-fires were burning; martial music was filling
the air; Colonel Nickerson had marched his
Fourteenth Regiment of Maine Volunteers through
Augusta, and had come to a “parade rest” on
Water Street; troops were coming and troops were
going; the papers were filled with news from
every quarter, containing even Jeff. Davis’ message
to the rebel congress. All was life and
animation. Events were hastening to the emancipation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
of the slave. It was the demand of the
hour. From soldier in the field, citizen in the
home and place of business, and from resolute,
far-seeing statesmen in congressional halls, came
the imperative call to “free and arm the slaves!”</p>

<p>Will the negro fight? was a question gravely
discussed over the North. Fred. Douglas, the
colored orator of that time, was asked it by the
president of Rochester University, and the keen-eyed
man replied,</p>

<p>“I am only half a negro, and I know I’d
fight.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the genial and scholarly president,
Martin B. Anderson, with a merry twinkle
in his eye, “if half a negro would fight, Mr.
Douglas, what would a whole one do?”</p>

<p>After a session of seventy-eight days, in which
“the public business had been completed with
all possible promptness,” the legislature adjourned.
“During the past two years,” the record says,
“with the same presiding officers in the senate
and House,—Hon. John H. Goodenow, of Alfred,
in the senate, and Hon. James G. Blaine, of Augusta,
in the House,—there has not been a single
appeal from their decisions.”</p>

<p>It is also said that the high character of the
legislature of 1862 stands unrivalled in Maine, in
members of legislative experience, men of practical
business talent, men learned and ready in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
debate, men wise in political action and patriotic
in purpose. Surely it were an honor to stand
at the head of such a body of men.</p>

<p>Very soon the Third Congressional Convention
would be held to nominate the successor to A.
P. Morrill. The three counties embraced in the
district,—Kennebec, Somerset, and Lincoln,—sent
to the legislature six senators and twenty-eight
representatives.</p>

<p>The district is an extensive one, embracing
seventy-five towns, and extending from the Atlantic
to the Canada line, inhabited by an intelligent
and influential body of freemen, deeply
interested in the welfare of the country, and
devoted to the principles and purposes of the
administration of Abraham Lincoln. The unqualified
and emphatic declination of Mr. Morrill to
be a candidate for re-election, rendered it necessary
to take a new man for the position.</p>

<p>“The superior ability and high qualifications of
Hon. James G. Blaine drew toward him the spontaneous
and almost unanimous support of the friends
of the national administration in the district.”</p>

<p>At two o’clock on Friday afternoon of July 11,
1862, the ballot was taken, and only one was
needed. Whole number of votes, one hundred
and eighty-one; Hon. James G. Blaine had one
hundred and seventy-four; W. R. Flint, five; scattering,
two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>This is the simple record, and Mr. Blaine was
declared nominated, and “the result was made
unanimous with enthusiasm and mutual congratulations.”
He was brought in, and with something
of sober diction, evidently feeling the greatness
of the honor and the responsibility upon him,
he only pledged his best intentions and most
earnest efforts to serve the constituency of the
district to the best of his ability, should he be
elected.</p>

<p>“If so, I shall go with a determination to
stand heartily and unreservedly by the administration
of Abraham Lincoln. In the success of
that administration, in the good providence of
God, rests, I solemnly believe, the fate of the
Union.</p>

<p>“Perish all things else,” he exclaims, “the nation’s
life must be saved. If slavery or any other
institution stands in the way, it must be removed.
I think the loyal masses are rapidly adopting
the idea that to smite the rebellion, its malignant
cause must be smitten. Perhaps we are
slow in coming to it, and it may be even now
we are receiving our severe chastisement for not
more readily accepting the teachings of Providence.</p>

<p>“It was the tenth plague which softened the
heart of Pharaoh and caused him to let the oppressed
go free. That plague was the sacrificing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
of the first-born in every household, and with
the sanguinary battle-fields, whose records of
death we are just reading, I ask you in the
language of another, how far off are we from
the day when our households will have paid that
penalty to offended heaven?”</p>

<p>After his nomination Mr. Blaine went on a
short visit to his old home in Washington, Penn.
His mother was still living; many friends and
relatives, beside business interests, demanding attention.
He had been gone but eight years,
and four of them he had spent in the legislature,
and now was nominated for congress, with
a certainty of election. He had come on a visit
to the old scenes of childhood, and early manhood,
and could present himself to them as he
soon did to the nation, covered with honor.</p>

<p>He returned just in time to attend a great
mass-meeting in Augusta. The two calls for
troops, each for three hundred thousand, were
out. Senator Lot M. Morrill, a brother of the
ex-governor, had just made a strong speech,
saying “we have been playing at arms before,
but now we are going to fight,” etc., and closed,
when there were loud calls for Blaine, and he
appeared, burning with enthusiasm, and kindled
all hearts with his presence and patriotic appeals.</p>

<p>On Monday, Sept. 8, 1862, Mr. Blaine was
first elected to congress. Although it was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
state campaign in which he was elected, conducted
by Mr. Blaine in person, aided by able
lieutenants and a governor,—five congressmen
and a host of minor officials were to be elected,—the
work was prosecuted with vigor.</p>

<p>A draft is threatened. Maine’s quota must be
filled, and it was during this same month of
September the Emancipation Proclamation appeared,
and two months later General McClellan
was relieved, and General Burnside put in command
of the army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>The great events of national importance would
of course over-shadow all state matters of minor
importance, comparatively, and to which the
public mind was accustomed. Beside, the mind
and heart of the new congressman were full of
the nation’s interest. Women were going to the
front as nurses,—more than forty had gone
from one town in Maine; the Mississippi was
open now clear to the Gulf; General Butler was
in New Orleans. Volumes of history were made
in a day, much of it unwritten history, traced
only in saddened faces, swollen, tearful eyes, in
nights of watchings, in sobs and sighs, and long
farewells, in fields billowed with mounds, and in
the dark shadows that even now will not be
chased away from many a heart, from many
a hearth-stone. How little is ever heard or
known of the dark dreamings still of a multitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
all silent and alone, when night is on
the earth.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine encountered one of the hard-headed
men, yet men of harder hearts, during
his campaign up in Clinton township, a hard,
Democratic hold. General Logan used to call
them copperheads down in southern Illinois during
the war. They have mostly emigrated since
then. At the close of the speech one of them
arose up and said,—a fellow of grizzly beard,</p>

<p>“Well, young man, you’ve made a right smart
speech, but if it is a sin to hold slaves, how
about Gineral Washington?”</p>

<p>This was one of Mr. Blaine’s strong points, to
answer questions, and so keep up a running fire
through his speech. He has lately told us how
he enjoyed, not so much to turn the tables on
the questioner, as to get at the minds of the
people, and then turn on the light just where it
is needed. But to this brave fellow up in Clinton,
he quietly replied,</p>

<p>“Yes, but General Washington manumitted his
slaves before he died.”</p>

<p>“Manu, what?”</p>

<p>“Manumitted them, set them free, gave them
their liberty.”</p>

<p>“O yes,” and the man sat down.</p>

<p>In his stump speeches effectiveness is his chief
object, and he strives with all the power in him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
to conquer his foe, and is fully determined to
do it. He ascertains his weak point, and assaults
him there. He does not apply his battering-ram
all over the wall, but on that particular place of
weakness. He sees the strong points, and has been
noted for his ability to see almost at a glance,
the strong and weak points of a bill. This has
served him when canvassing for large majorities.
He would study the enemy thoroughly, know him
without mistake, beyond the possibility of ambush
or surprise, and then enlist his own forces, and
enough of them without fail for certain victory,
organize them for something more than simple
victory, plan the battle, and then call no halt until
the work was done. None can be more elegant
or choice and beautiful in the use of language
when occasion requires, but in the canvas the
great elements of style are plainness, great plainness,
and force, tremendous force.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine was a Republican before there was
a party, and has fought, and written, and argued,
and plead for all the great interests its existence
has subserved, and of which it is the conservator
to-day. That eternal vigilance which is the
price of liberty, is not to be kept up on picket
posts or parapets, but where laws are made and
judged and executed. He learned his tactics in
the war times, and up to the last experience in
the House, he fought those he felt were traitors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
still and tried to crush him; and who shall not
say that in point and fact the South has ruled
the South the past fifteen years, as truly as
though they were a separate people,—solid, separate,
and distinct.</p>

<p>When elected to congress a great work opened
up before Mr. Blaine. It was the work of preparation.
His old methods of thoroughness must
prevail; mastery must be his watchword still.
Augusta was not Washington; Kennebec county
was not the District of Columbia; Maine was
not the nation, nor the state legislature the congress
of the nation. The resources that gave
him prominence and power in one sphere, would
be but a small fortune in the other. This history
of congress must be deeply studied, the history
of men and of measures. He must know
all. There may be dark spots on the sun, but
must be none in his mind. They may be necessary
there, but not here. The charge of ignorance
must not be his. The craving to
know devours all before it. Just over there in
New Hampshire is the warning of Franklin Pierce,
great in his own state, but little out in the nation.
This is before him; but this is not the
incentive. It is rather the habit of his life to
touch bottom, and sides, and top.</p>

<p>This was sacred honor to him, to carry into
a place or position to which he is called, what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
will fill it, or not to enter. So now he gives
the winter largely to this work. It is sacred
work to him. Manliness demands it; self-respect
makes it imperative. But he loves it. It is opportunity
to him. And surely with all his former
years of conquest, no one ever came to such
task with more of fitness for the task.</p>

<p>And yet, though flushed with victory from other
fields, the echo of the people’s cheers still ringing
in his heart, and their laurels unfaded on
his brow, he feels, he knows there is a lack of
that strength and fulness which have ever been
to him the harbingers of victory.</p>

<p>How many have run through congress much
as they ran for congress, because they took it
for granted that preparation for a law office or a
stump speech was preparation for congress; just
as many a deluded theorist has drifted from college
out into life, dreaming that preparation for
a senior examination was preparation for the competition
of life.</p>

<p>There was ever a charm to Mr. Blaine about
the study of character. Gov. Abner Coburn was
Mr. Blaine’s ideal of a business man. He loved
anything large and grand in human nature, and
anybody good and true, and Abner Coburn,—as
a man of great ability, of great wealth and
liberality, giving away fifty thousand dollars
at a time, and withal a noble Christian gentleman,—was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
to him among the best and
worthiest.</p>

<p>He loved characters if at all remarkable for
hard common sense, and so he loved to meet
and talk with one Miles Standish, from way up
in Somerset county, at Flagstaff Plantation.
Plantations abound in the state of Maine. There
are twenty-five of them in Aroostook county,
which is said to be as large as the state of
Massachusetts. These plantations are a mild
form of government, rather below the usual
township organization, and yet covering a township
of land six miles square.</p>

<p>This Mr. Standish used frequently to come to
Augusta, and it was a pleasant hour for Mr.
Blaine to meet him. He was human nature in
crude state, or in the original package. Unspoiled
by art, or science, or philosophy, and
yet full of quaint, original ideas, and quainter
forms of expression. He was never in a hurry
when he met him, and yet it was not for sport
or fun at his expense, but for the boldness of
his personality, and the rocky-like substance of
his character.</p>

<p>This was a great part of his effort in life to
understand men, to know them, and a high
authority has defined just this as common sense.
To know a man, says the distinguished scholar
referred to, is knowledge, but to know men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
that is common sense. It lets one out of
a thousand blunders and into a thousand secrets;
it gives one the science of character-building,
as one may have the science of
architecture. It is a study of the higher sciences,
such as moral and mental, in their original
sources.</p>

<p>Right here is the open letter of Mr. Blaine’s
career. First, he knows the strong points, and
then he knows the weak points, and he has his
man every time, for he certainly has a key that
will unlock him, only let him know what one
to use. And it is not a matter of artful, politic
chicanery, and legerdemain. He simply studies
the individual, and then with ease of manner
and a wise, discriminating grace of diction, adapts
or adjusts himself to them. Thomas Carlyle
would use a hurricane, it is said, to waft a
feather; Mr. Blaine would never.</p>

<p>And again Carlyle employed the weight of his
mighty genius to emphasize the sumless worth
of a man, and yet he did not have common
sense sufficient to treat half who called upon
him with common civility. What avails this
solemn prating, impoverishing the lexicon and
wearying genius to express a cynical, over-wrought
view of man in his high-born greatness, if, when
Ralph Waldo Emerson crosses the Atlantic and
calls upon him with compliments of the highest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
order, he receives only replies that sting, and
burn, and rankle?</p>

<p>Exactly the reverse of Carlyle has been the
method of Mr. Blaine. Men have been his
glory, his study, and delight. This was his first
work in Augusta, his first work in the state
legislature, his first work in congress. And not
their names alone, but their political history,
their pedigree,—all about them. They must all
be weighed and measured, sized and classified.
And he must know himself as well, and how
far he can reach, and how firm he can grasp,
and how much he can lift. He uses only the
powers of his personality, and these must all
be toned and tempered anew.</p>

<p>He has gone to congress to stay, and not to
experiment, but for the work of life. He carries
with him just the power to get the power
which he shall need,—the seed-corn for the
large, abundant harvest. But he must work and
cultivate, and this he knows right well how to
do, and so he does and will. It is his purpose,
and that purpose is fixed.</p>

<p>Right well he knows that there is no power
that causes growth like contact with strong, determined
personalities,—intelligent, conscientious,
affectionate, purposeful. It is mind that makes
mind grow, that plants the seeds and brings on
the harvest by the shining of its light; and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
heart by getting into heart, expands it and
causes growth, and conscience rouses conscience,
and will awakens will, and all cause growth. He
has not forgotten those lifts out of childhood
almost into manhood, when the great faces of
Jackson, Harrison, and Clay shone upon him,
and now he is the friend and confident of the
great Lincoln, and they are to be within an
evening’s call, and the great men of the nation
are there and will soon be etched, photographed,
or painted, and hung up within the gallery of
his large soul.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>T is said that life in Washington is a
liberal education, social life in particular,
but public life as well. The great
interests of the nation center there,
and all nations are represented there. Life is
intense in all respects. Victors gather there from
all fields of contest. They are at their best,
and have multitudes to cheer them on, or cry
them down, if they fail or falter. The door of
prosperity to the country hinges there; defective
legislation closes it, and mars the delicately balanced
confidence in the business world. It is the nation’s
higher school of politics, or rather university,
with all its great departments. Graduates
from all the state academies are there, taking observations
of the nation and the world, discussing
all live questions, following out great lines of
thought, fixing policies, framing laws and enacting
them. The arts and sciences flourish there,
scholars congregate from all parts of the land.
To them it is a place of mighty interests; institutions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
and libraries abound, history is manufactured
day by day. Strong men in pride and
power are in their glory there.</p>

<p>Society is like a myriad-sided palace, with many
a gate of entrance and of exit, but all most
deftly closed except to bearer of the keys,—a
palace filled with light of knowledge, and resplendent
with beauty; the goal of every clique
and clan the nation over, where all the aristocracies
of the Republic may glow and shine and
shine and glow, and all the courtiers of all the
nations mingle in magnificent and pompous array.
Guards are at every door. Passports are in demand.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock, the 7th of December, 1863,
Mr. Blaine was in his seat. His heart beat high,
his hopes were great. Earnest faces of determined
men were all about him. The administration
had a clear working majority, but there
could scarcely have been seventeen Democrats
from New York to fourteen Union Republicans,
had not one hundred and fifty thousand men
been at the front from that state, and not permitted
to vote until the presidential election.
And so with Lincoln’s own state of Illinois,
which just before the war gave him such a great
majority, now sends nine Democrats to five Union
Republicans to congress, and has over one hundred
thousand men in the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>In the Pennsylvania delegation the result is
similar, though the administration is endorsed by
six thousand two hundred and thirty-one majority,—which
would have been vastly increased if her
one hundred thousand soldiers had been permitted
to vote, as they were a year or two later.</p>

<p>Out of figures sent from the field then were
shown to be five thousand two hundred and sixty-seven
Republican votes in a total ballot of
seven thousand one hundred and twenty-two, in
over thirty organizations; but most of these were
from Iowa, a state with such Republican majorities
that when Mr. Blaine was urged to speak
there during the campaign of 1876, replied,</p>

<p>“What is the use of burnishing gold?”</p>

<p>But there had been a vast amount of political
light spread over that state during the years that
intervened from 1862 and ’63 to 1876.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine had spent a year as a quiet observer
and a deep and diligent student since his
election in September, 1862.</p>

<p>No course could have been wiser than the one
adopted by Mr. Blaine. None from the state
was more popular, and so none had a heavier
correspondence. It related to all departments of
the government, and he must at once gain influence
in all. And this he did, with the greatest
certainty of results. He was most obliging. It
was soon found out, and all parties, without respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
to politics, wrote him for favors of various
characters, and they never appealed in vain.</p>

<p>A Democrat of the deepest dye, a malignant
enemy of Mr. Blaine politically, had a son in
the army who had deserted, was tried by a court-martial,
found guilty, and condemned to be shot,
according to the army law in such cases. The
father appealed to Mr. Blaine to use his good
offices with the great-hearted president in behalf
of his son’s release.</p>

<p>True to his instincts as a man, and his fidelity
in all matters of public trust, utterly destitute
of a prejudice, and without a particle of enmity
to curdle the milk of human kindness by its
lightning-stroke, to poison his motive or weaken
his purpose to truly represent the people, he
went at once to Mr. Lincoln, and so presented
the facts, and plead for the life of the young
man, that the pardon was granted, and he was
transferred from the guard-house to his place in
the regiment at the front.</p>

<p>And it is a simple fact that a brother of that
same young man hooted the nomination of Mr.
Blaine recently upon the streets of Augusta. So
little does gratitude hold sway in the breasts of
some!</p>

<p>It is a singular coincidence that Mr. Blaine
and Mr. Garfield had entered so nearly together,
and both so nearly of an age; but they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
both great students, and ready for the service
required at their hands.</p>

<p>Some have said that Mr. Blaine spent his first
term in congress in quiet observation, without
being read, seen, or heard. This would not be
his nature. He would not be there if he was
to be simply an onlooker. This he could be from
the galleries. Such a course would be crucifixion,
and an acknowledgment of inefficiency and incompetency.
Within two weeks after entrance we
find him participating in debate.</p>

<p>The secretary of war had sent a note to the
Committee on Ways and Means, requesting an
immediate appropriation of twenty million dollars
for bounties, to encourage more rapid enlistment.
The chairman had reported the item at once, and
there was no delay in calling it up, and in its
discussion he took part. His first resolution related
to the prompt payment of prize-money to
the officers and seamen of the navy, and was
offered Jan. 6, 1864.</p>

<p>Six days after he rose to oppose the views of
the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee
in appropriating seven hundred thousand dollars
to pay a Pennsylvania claim only six months
old, when claims filed eighteen months before
by the state of Maine were unpaid. It was
a claim for enlisting, arming, and organizing
troops to guard the navy-yard and coast at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
Kittery and Portsmouth when cruisers endangered
them.</p>

<p>On April 21st Mr. Blaine presented his first
bill, having reference to this same subject of war-claims
of the state against the nation, the subject
having remained in an unsettled condition.
His bill is a model of excellence, providing for a
commission of three, appointed by the president,
to receive, examine, and endorse state claims, etc.,
against the general government, and order the
payment of the same, after a specified time fixed
in the future, so heavy were the drafts then upon
the national treasury. He supported the measure
with a speech of great breadth of view and
comprehensiveness of statement, occupying ten
columns of the <i>Congressional Globe</i>. Mr. Hamilton’s
refunding measure, after the war of the Revolution,
was used in argument, and also the adoption
of similar measures after the war with England
in 1812 to ’15, and also the Mexican war.</p>

<p>He was replied to by Mr. Dawes of Massachusetts,
and a general debate ensued. He had
now fairly entered upon his congressional career,
and seems to have come with a bound into a
position that numbered him at once with the
leading members. He was easily at the head of
his delegation; he commanded the attention of
the House, which some members never do. He
was recognized, assented to, opposed in person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
and particulars, co-operated with, and in various
ways was it manifest that he had gained in a
session what never comes to many members.</p>

<p>We find his resolutions and amendments passing;
his points of order sustained. He is referred
to on over fifty pages of the <i>Congressional
Globe</i>, in remarks, resolutions, amendments, bills,
etc. He has something to say on all great
measures of importance that come before the
House. He shows himself at home upon all
the questions receiving attention, and watches
the drift of proceedings with close and careful
eye, and shows an abiding interest in all that
is going on. The matter in hand seems ever
to be just the matter in his mind. He is from
the start a “working-member.” There are members
who are not classed as working-members.
They listen and look on; work does not agree
with them; they do not like it. They have an
equal chance with all the others, but they are
afraid to speak out; to take a position and defend
it.</p>

<p>Intelligence is an important factor in such a
man, and it is hardly wise or best for a man,
although he is a member, to “speak out in
meeting” unless he surely has something to say
and knows how to say it, and can really get it
off, and to the point. Men may go into battle
by regiments, brigades, corps, and divisions, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
no man flinch; but they do not act that way
on the floor of congress. It is worse than a
battle-field in some respects; takes courage of a
different type. They must go in alone, and fire
away, with several hundred keen eyes upon them.
They will quale and tremble, falter and trip in
a little sentence, and stand there, pale and
blanched with fear, while the same one might
mount a horse and charge into hottest battle,
midst fearful carnage, with the tinge of highest
courage mantling cheek and brow.</p>

<p>In his eloquent eulogy of Mr. Garfield, Mr.
Blaine says: “There is no test of a man’s ability
in any department of public life more severe
than service in the House of Representatives.
There is no place where so little deference is
paid to reputation previously acquired, or to
eminence won outside; no place where so little
consideration is shown for the feelings or failures
of beginners. What a man gains in the
House, he gains by sheer force of his own
character, and if he loses and falls back he
must expect no mercy, and will receive no sympathy.
It is a field in which the survival of
the strongest is the recognized rule, and where
no pretense can deceive, and no glamour can
mislead. The real man is discovered, his worth
is impartially weighed, and his rank is irreversibly
decreed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>A long and strong experience had convinced
him of the deep, historic truth of this utterance.
The challenge seemed constantly to be,
“What are you doing here?” The waves dashed
high, and the undertow was dreadful. One can
easily read between the lines the battle Mr.
Blaine had with himself at his first rising in
the House, which was simply to read in evidence
on the pending discussion a few sentences
from the report of the secretary of the treasury,
he was met by a slight rebuff from old General
Schenk of Ohio, to the effect that the matter
was irrelevant.</p>

<p>He was not Mr. Speaker any more, and felt
the newness of his situation, but he belonged
there, and he proposed to whip and win, and
so he sets himself to work to draft a bill, and
works, and watches his opportunity for four
months, and not until December 21st is lost in
April 21st does just his opportunity come; but
when it came he showed by a speech of nearly
two hours in length, full of hard, solid facts,
arguments forged with something of the weight
and power of thunderbolts, bristling with statistics,
and fairly boiling with his richest and most fervid
eloquence, that he knew his rights, and knowing,
dared maintain them. And it was in discussing this
same bill on which he and Schenk had spoken,
and which had kept afloat, or anchored in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
House in various forms of bill, resolve, or amendment,
that he won his spurs in this splendid
speech. He did not let it come to final passage
until he had shown his power of relevancy, and
convinced the General from Ohio that men were
not elected speakers up in Maine until they
could fairly discriminate between tweedle de and
tweedle dum.</p>

<p>Meantime, what he said of Garfield is true of
him: “He stepped to the front with the confidence
of one who belonged there.”</p>

<p>Nineteen of those who sat with Mr. Blaine
when he first took his place in the House, have
been chosen United States senators since then.
Many served well as governors, and many in
the foreign service of their country. “But among
them all, none grew more rapidly; none more
firmly,” are his words of that other one, but they
are just as true of himself. His early course
in congress was marked by great courage and
persistency.</p>

<p>Two others had failed to secure the adoption
of an amendment to the bill for the establishment
of national banks, to the effect that interest
should be uniform when not fixed by state
law, and though it had been voted on and defeated
before; though its form had been changed,
yet seeing the wisdom of it, and having the
courage of his conviction, he moved it again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
and made a short, ringing speech of not over
fifteen minutes, and it was carried by a vote of
sixty-nine to thirty-one. Such power to control
legislation so soon after entering congress, clearly
reveals the influence already gained.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, when the committee on the
penitentiary in the District of Columbia reported
a bill appropriating two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars for the purpose, he was ready to
oppose. He had been one of the chairmen of
the prison committee in the Maine legislature,
had been on a committee or commission appointed
by the governor to visit prisons elsewhere
and gain full information concerning them,
having, with his customary energy and thoroughness,
visited seventeen, and found they were
being run at great expense to the several states,
and so he opposed the bill, as prisoners were
being kept safely in prisons already established,
and, as he said, the proposed amount would
only start the work and make many hundred
thousands a necessity.</p>

<p>Whatever the question of national or state
importance that came before the House, he had
made himself familiar with it. And so we find
him speaking on the revenue, conscription, and
currency bills; legislative appropriation and tariff
bills; the Fugitive Slave Law and the civil appropriation
bills, beside the bill relating to Pennsylvania<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
war-expenses. The terrible battle of
Gettysburgh had been fought the summer before,
and the state heavily involved, and the effort
was to have her re-imbursed.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine was heartily on the side of the
administration and the war, supporting the
various measures of prosecution and relief as
against the opposition, with all the power in him.
But it was not a blind support. It must be
wise, intelligent, and discriminating, to put him
in the fullest action, and bring on what might
so soon be termed accustomed triumph.</p>

<p>But there came a day on the twenty-first of
June, and during the first session of his first
congress,—the thirty-eighth,—that a bill came
into the House embodying a report from
James B. Fry provost-marshal general, endorsed
definitely by Edwin M. Stanton, secretary of
war, and concurred in by Abraham Lincoln,
proclaiming the conscription act a failure. The
bill had come from the committee on military
affairs, through their chairman. The exact point
in the bill that had proved objectionable, and
which they desired expunged, was what is known
as the three hundred dollar clause, enabling any
drafted man by the payment of the above sum
to procure a substitute, and so be relieved himself.
This very feature of the bill Mr. Blaine
had incorporated as his first amendment offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
in congress, and enforced by a vigorous speech,
which carried it through, and now a repeal of
it would compel any business man in the country,
if drafted, to go at once, provided only he was
fit for military service. This would take the
best physician, with the largest practice, in the
greatest city of the Union.</p>

<p>“Such a conscription,” said Mr. Blaine, “was
never resorted to but once, even in the French
Empire, under the absolutism of the First Napoleon;
and for the congress of the United States
to attempt its enforcement upon their constituents
is to ignore the best principles of republican
representative government.”</p>

<p>Remarkable as it may seem, and specially so
in view of the fact that he had but fifteen
minutes granted him to speak, his motion prevailed
by a vote of one hundred to fifty. Such
men as Boutwell, Brooks, Dawes, McDowell,
Edward H. Rollins, Schofield, Wadsworth, and
Wheeler, stood with him. Mr. Stanton’s idea
was that by forcing into the field a great army
of soldiers the war might be speedily terminated.
But freemen cannot be dealt with as slaves.
There is a vast difference between the purely
military and the truly civil view of a question.</p>

<p>A few days after the same bill was up again,
for further repairs, when we get a fine view of
Mr. Blaine. It was Saturday afternoon, June 25,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
1864. Mr. Mallory, of Kentucky, was making a
long speech against the feature of the bill that
provided for enlisting the negro, when he observed
Mr. Blaine watching him. He said,—</p>

<p>“My friend from Maine (Mr. Blaine), who seems
to be listening so attentively, lived in Kentucky
once, and knows the negro and his attributes,
and he knows, if he will tell you what he
knows, that they won’t fight.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine: “From a residence of five years
in Kentucky, I came to the conclusion from
what I saw of the negroes, that there was a
good deal of fight in them.”</p>

<p>After a pleasant colloquy, he went on to
state that during the Crimean war Egypt furnished
Turkey fifteen regiments of negroes of
pure blood, unmixed from the foundation of the
world, and as good troops as ever marched upon
European soil. And so the debate went on.
One thing seems quite evident: Mr. Blaine had
come to feel perfectly at home on the floor of
the House. His quiet ways and quick-witted replies;
the conversational character of the proceedings
at times, in which he participates; his
familiarity with men and their almost constant
recognition of him; the fluent and undisturbed
character of his sentences; the general ease and
pleasure of the man, and the home-like air that
seems constantly to surround him, show that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
is in his element. But he is always there, and
very attentive, keeping up with the great debates
as they are carried on day after day.
Nothing seems to escape him, and every move
is a cautious one. Even then he must have
been the pride of his state.</p>

<p>He had not listened so attentively to the
speech of the Kentuckian, Mr. Mallory, for
naught, in which it was asserted that Mr. Lincoln
issued the Emancipation Proclamation in
consequence of pressure brought to bear upon
him by a meeting of governors of the loyal
states, at Altoona, Penn., the autumn of 1862.
Having armed himself with documentary proof,
so that he might be doubly sure, though his
memory told him he was right, he thus corners
the gentleman in the neatest manner possible.</p>

<p>“I understood the gentleman (Mr. Mallory, of
Kentucky) to assert,” said Mr. Blaine, “and to
reiterate with great emphasis, that the Emancipation
Proclamation was issued in consequence of
the pressure brought to bear upon the president
by the meeting of the governors at Altoona, in
the autumn of 1862.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mallory. “I said it was issued in consequence
of the pressure brought to bear by these
governors.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine. “Will the gentleman state at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
what date the president’s proclamation was
issued?”</p>

<p>Mr. Mallory. “On the 22d of September.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine. “Will the gentleman state further
at what date the meeting of the governors took
place at Altoona?”</p>

<p>Mr. Mallory. “Some days before.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine. “Not at all, sir. That meeting
was on the 24th of September, two days after
the proclamation was issued.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mallory. “Oh, no.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine. “Yes, sir; I am correct. I had
a personal recollection of the date, and I have
further certified it by documentary evidence,
which I sent for and now hold in my hand.”</p>

<p>Of course the man squirmed and tried to escape,
but he was held by a firm hand to the
grave discrepancy of which he had been guilty,
involving the governors of all the loyal states
in an instigation of which they were guiltless
as a body of men, in convention assembled.
Then he tried to escape by asserting that the
governors were on at Washington, laboring with
the president to secure the same end. But he
was assured most emphatically, that such was
not the case, as they all were extremely busy,
and no time for a week’s excursion to Washington.</p>

<p>Governor Washburn, of Maine, had invited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
Mr. Blaine to accompany him to this meeting
of the governors, but pressure of duties forbade.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine closed the little contest for supremacy,
with the Kentucky gentleman, with this
single sentence: “The anachronism into which
my friend has been led, and which I have thus
pointed out, is quite as conclusive in the premises
as Mr. Weller hoped the alibi would prove
in the celebrated Pickwickian trial.”</p>

<p>A pleasant thing about the episode is that
Mr. Boutwell, of Massachusetts, afterwards President
Grant’s secretary of the treasury, yielded
his own time upon the floor to Mr. Blaine, for
the friendly tilt in the interest of the Union,
and the pending war-measure.</p>

<p>It proved conclusively that congress is no
place for a Fourth of July oration, but for clear
heads, well-managed tongues, and brave hearts,
such as Mr. Blaine seems never to be without.</p>

<p>A long session of congress was being held
on into the middle of summer, and many of
the old laws relating to slavery were being abolished,
among them one that related to the
coastwise slave trade, which was interlaced with
the coastwise trade of rightful commerce. It
comprised thirty-two sections, so bound up together
as to make a sort of a code on the
subject. It, of course, bore directly upon the
shipping interests of Maine, and brought Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
Blaine to his feet more than once during the
discussion. The effort was made to revise them
in the interest of New York city, and so discriminate
sharply against New England ports.
The condition of that city, at this time, was
very bad politically. It was about the time of
the draft-riots, when Tilden addressed the mob,
calling the rioters “My friends.” Of course Mr.
Blaine was thoroughly informed, and he made a
strong point against the measure of the New
York member, Mr. Brooks. “To-day,” he said,
“in New York city, the sentiment is anti-American,
and were it submitted to voters of the
city of New York now, whether they would
have Jeff Davis president, or a loyal Republican
Union man, North, Jeff Davis would have thirty
thousand votes ahead,” and a voice said, “What
of that?” And Mr. Brooks, the gentleman from
New York, admitted that there were fifty thousand
majority now in New York city opposed
to Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>This was six months and seven days after the
Proclamation of Emancipation, and showed that,
though the great heart of that noble state beat
true, and, as was a fact, had sent about two
hundred thousand troops to the war, yet the
mass in the city, left behind, were weakening
largely the Union cause. It was a feature of
the struggle with slavery continually felt, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
only in congress, but in the execution of laws
for the strengthening of the cause.</p>

<p>In reply to “What of that?”—that is, what
of it if Jeff Davis could receive thirty thousand
majority in New York city—he said: “Just this:
if gentlemen suppose that the whole country
will contribute to the prosperity and growth of
the city under such circumstances, they are under
a perfect delusion,” and then he went for
the man who said “What of that?” in his own
princely style.</p>

<p>He encounters first “Sunset” Cox, then of
Ohio, now of New York, the wit of the House,
and there is a perfect fusilade of questionings
and replies, sharp retorts and pertinent sallies,
and though they are after him from all sides,
Cox, Randall, Arnold, Brooks, yet he holds his
position with a fearless hand, standing firm as
an admiral on the deck of his flag-ship in the
squadron, amid the boom and smoke, the thunder,
and flash, and roar of a naval engagement;
just as intrepid, just as grand; no twitching of
nerve, or faltering of muscle; he is commander
of the situation, and never strikes his flag.</p>

<p>Nearly a month before the adjournment of
congress the Union National Republican Convention
met at Baltimore (June 7), to nominate a
president.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln had been regarded as too conservative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
by the extreme radical wing of the party,
notwithstanding the slaves were free, and armed,
and organized by the thousands in defence of
the Union; and Grant had been so successful in
the West, he had been brought East and made
lieutenant-general, having fought his way from
Fort Henry to Pittsburgh Landing, to Vicksburg,
and to Chattanooga. But the war had been prolonged
beyond the expectation of the people.
Rebels were still on the banks of the Rappahannock
and the Tennessee. A few defeats, loss
of men, great expenditures of money, and a rather
dormant campaign during the winter, had produced
some despondency and doubt.</p>

<p>Secretary Chase, with his powerful position in
the cabinet and at the head of the treasury, was
known to be seeking the presidency, and so he
became the centre around which clustered various
elements of discontent and opposition. He was
the head, it is said, of the radical forces in the
cabinet, as Mr. Seward was of the conservative
forces. But though a man of great prominence,
and of great power, a man with a splendid record
as a political chief of the Free-soil party
that had battled slavery before the war, his legislature
of Ohio pronounced for Mr. Lincoln, and
Mr. Chase at once withdrew.</p>

<p>But everything was at fever-heat. The “radical
men of the nation” were invited to meet at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
Cleveland on the 31st of May, eight days before
the Republican Convention met at Baltimore.
“It was simply a mass convention of one hundred
and fifty persons, claiming to come from
fifteen states.” General Frémont was put forward
as candidate for president, and Gen. John Cochrane,
of New York, for vice-president, and all in
violent opposition to Mr. Lincoln, as the call indicated,
and General Frémont’s letter of acceptance
confirmed. If anybody else was nominated,
he would not be a candidate.</p>

<p>This was the state of affairs when Mr. Blaine
went with his delegation to Baltimore, where
Union troops were first fired upon less than three
years before.</p>

<p>It seems exceeding strange as we look back
upon it now, that anyone could be found in all
the North, and especially among his party, men
who could oppose a man so great and worthy as
Abraham Lincoln, and even attack the wisdom of
his administration and the rectitude of his intentions,
just as some were found to attack Washington,
notwithstanding the magnitude of his service,
the splendor of his life, and the magnificence
of his character.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine was among the staunchest friends of
the president, and cannot look, even from this
distance of years, with any respect, upon the actions
of those who sought to undermine him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
He regarded it as unwise, cruel, and next to disloyalty.
But it availed not,—he was too proudly
enthroned amid the affections of the people, so
that every effort of opposition but increased their
love and zeal for him, and made his nomination,
which came in due time, doubly sure.</p>

<p>This convention, in which Mr. Blaine bore so
signal a part, was full of interest, not only for
the sake of Mr. Lincoln, but also of Vice-president
Hannibal Hamlin, of his own state.</p>

<p>Many eminent men were included in its roll of
delegates. Not less than five of the leading war-governors
were chosen to participate in its councils.
Vermont sent Solomon Foote, who had
stood faithful in the senate during the struggle
before the war. Massachusetts had commissioned
her eloquent governor, John A. Andrew. Henry
J. Raymond, Daniel S. Dickinson, and Lyman
Tremaine were there from New York. New Jersey
and Ohio each sent two ex-governors,—Marcus
L. Ward and William A. Newell from the
former, and William Dennison and David Tod
from the latter. Simon Cameron, Thaddeus Stevens,
and Ex-Speaker Grow, of Pennsylvania; Governor
Blair and Omer D. Conger, of Michigan;
Angus Cameron, of Wisconsin, and George W.
McCrary, of Iowa, were among the other delegates.</p>

<p>Governor Morgan, of New York, called the convention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
to order, and Dr. Robert J. Breckenridge
was chosen temporary chairman, who, on taking
the chair, delivered the great speech of the convention,
as Mr. Blaine thinks. It impressed him
deeply, and he refers to it with emotions of admiration
to-day.</p>

<p>He was a tall, sturdy man, of Scotch extraction
and advanced in years, which, with his history,
inspired reverence. His speech was “sharp,
sinewy, and defiant.” He had been reared amidst
Slavery, but was for the Union. “The nation
shall not be destroyed,” he said. “We shall
change the Constitution if it suits us to do so.
The only enduring, the only imperishable cement
of all free institutions, has been the blood of
traitors,” he said with thrilling effect; and added
regarding Slavery, “Use all power to exterminate
and extinguish it.”</p>

<p>“Next to the official platform itself,” said Mr.
Blaine, “the speech of Doctor Breckenridge was
the most inspiring utterance of the convention.”
Every vote in the convention was cast for Mr.
Lincoln on the first ballot, except twenty-two from
Missouri, which, by instruction, were cast for General
Grant.</p>

<p>When congress adjourned, July 4th, the great
campaign opened, and into it plunged Mr.
Blaine with all the fiery ardor of which his
nature was competent, and patriotism prompted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
and his personal friendship for Mr. Lincoln
could inspire.</p>

<p>Gen. George B. McClellan, who had been the
idol of the army for two years and a half, was
nominated by the Democrats. Mr. Blaine denominates
it “a canvass of extraordinary interest and
critical importance.” And such indeed it was,
coming as it did right in the midst of the great
war, when over a million men were in arms on
the continent, and the great summer and fall
campaigns were to be fought. It was, indeed, a
critical time for heated discussions, the grinding
of opposition, the friction of parties, constant irritation,
not only at home, throughout every city,
village, and hamlet of the North, but throughout
the army, in every camp and hospital, on the
march, at picket, post, and bivouac,—for the soldiers
were to vote.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a perilous time. No tongue
can tell, no mind can even dream, the results
that would have followed Mr. Lincoln’s defeat;
what reversals of history; what undoing of
mighty deeds; what paralysis of moral power in
the nation; what defeat of principle; what compromise
with wrong; what stagnation, downfall,
death. But it was not to be; it could not be.
High heaven’s decree was otherwise. Incompetence
was not to be rewarded. The great
North, when it spoke out for all the world to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
hear, had no premium to place upon supposed
disloyalty. The old ship of state was not to
change captains in mid-ocean; he who had
brought her by island, and rock, and reef, through
storm and tempest, through cyclone and hurricane,
safely thus far, was no Jonah, to be cast
overboard now. Few people in all the world
can know more clearly, feel more deeply, and
act more strongly when things thoroughly arouse,
than the American people, and none have more
to rouse them at times. Indeed, we have the
cream of all the nations, and so strike high
above the average. We heard of “thinking bayonets”
back there, and fife, and drum, and horn
that spoke the thoughts and love of men. The
triumph was complete.</p>

<p>There were but twenty-one votes in the electoral
college, when autumn came, for McClellan,
and two hundred and twelve for Mr. Lincoln.
The decree of a holy Providence had been recorded
with an emphasis as unmistakable as
doubtless would have been the case had the
Great Emancipator of Israel been subjected to
a test-vote in the wilderness.</p>

<p>It is probable that no period of the nation’s
history is so bright with victories, both civil and
military, as the sixty days succeeding the convention
at Chicago, Aug. 29, 1864, which nominated
General McClellan for the presidency,—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
period in which the labors of Mr. Blaine were indefatigable
for the Union cause, and to which he
referred with the emphasis of a life-time interest.</p>

<p>The Democrats voted the war a failure, and
then placed its leading general up to within
less than a year before, upon their platform.
And yet, while they were declaring the war a
failure, the news came that Fort Morgan was
captured, and Sherman took Atlanta the day after
they adjourned, and speedily came the successes
of Admiral Farragut in Mobile Bay.</p>

<p>A proclamation of thanksgiving was issued by
President Lincoln for the great Union victories
within two days after they had proposed, practically,
to surrender to traitors; and Secretary
Seward said in a public speech, “Sherman and
Farragut have knocked the planks out of the
Chicago platform.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Grant held Lee in a vise at Petersburgh,
and Sheridan, within three weeks of
Sherman’s capture of Atlanta, had dashed down
the Shenandoah valley and won three brilliant
victories in the battles of Winchester, Fisher’s
Hill, and Cedar Creek.</p>

<p>The political effect of these victories was just
what Mr. Lincoln had predicted. “With reverses
in the field,” he said, “the case is doubtful
at the polls; but with victory in the field,
the election will take care of itself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>And then came the civil victories,—Maine
and Vermont in September (and Mr. Blaine was
still chairman of the Republican State Central
Committee in Maine, and had to plan the entire
campaign, secure speakers, etc., etc.); then in
October, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, wheeled
into line, and “registered in advance the edict
of the people in regard to the presidency.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine had usually to remain in his own
state each summer after the adjournment of
congress, until after the election, and they had
one each year, which occurred the second Monday
in September, and as this would come from
the eighth to the twelfth of the month it gave
him from fifty to sixty days for campaign-work
in other states, which, during presidential years,
was fully and heartily improved. He was greatly
sought for, and would draw immense audiences,
and kindle an enthusiasm which would blaze and
burn, and smoulder, and then blaze forth again.
His offer of a thousand dollars a line for anything
that he has written the past year, expressing
in any way a desire for the nomination, is
proof that his nomination is but the result of
the old smouldering fires of almost boundless
and unquenchable enthusiasm blazing forth anew.
These fires that are burning now have been
kindled for ten or twenty years, and they have
been chiefly lighted during these fifty or sixty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
days intervening between September elections in
Maine and the October and November elections
in other states. While others might go to the
mountains or sea-shore to rest and rust, he would
breathe for two or three days, and respond to
some of the numerous calls for help where the
brunt of battle was heaviest, or the enemy
seemed strong and desperate.</p>

<p>He was always a hard hitter, and never played
at politics. It was business with him, and war.
He would wring the neck of a political heresy
with all the gusto an old Scotch Covenanter
would experience in hounding to the death a
religious heresy. There is such a thing as political
truth and political virtue to him. It is not
fancy and foible, chimera and dream, phantasm
and fable, but granite truth, and principle rock-like
and firm as adamant.</p>

<p>Something was fought for in the war, and that
something has been worth preserving, and is
to-day.</p>

<p>It is Liberty in purest form and on grandest
scale this world has ever known; the life of all
prosperity, the very spirit of peace, the inspiration
of all development, the law of all growth,
and the harbinger of hope’s brightest anticipations.</p>

<p>And so Mr. Blaine has done his great, best
work, not simply in the light of glowing idols,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
but in the glow of great victories achieved, and
the substance of great realities enjoyed, in a
mental and moral realization; and a country
broad, and grand, and free; its great cities,
rivers, forests, lakes, its ocean, mountains, prairies,
plains, and all its five and fifty million people,
to him a joy.</p>

<p>He takes it in and calls it ours,—the fair
inheritance of a people free,—for we inherit
one another too, in all that constitutes society,
community, city, and country.</p>

<p>We said he hit hard, struck out to win. It is
true. Each man before him must squirm or
cheer. There were no lookers on; he had no
idle issues, but live ones; personal, and things
of destiny.</p>

<p>When in Ohio once with Congressman Bingham,—and
he did not go that far from home
for nothing,—he got up a little political hail-storm
for the special benefit of the Democrats
present. Such a storm is usually produced by
two dark clouds coming together, heavily charged
with the double extract of electricity and other
substances. He brought one of those clouds with
him and manufactured the other one on the
spot out of materials in the audience.</p>

<p>The result was a good many were hit, and
hail hurts when it has a fair chance to strike,
and as that was well aimed it struck square.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
Among others, a man from the “old sod,”—an
Irishman,—who had in him what is rare in
Maine,—whiskey,—so after the speaking he
made for Mr. Blaine, determined to try his
shillalah upon the cranium of the honorable gentleman,
but just as he came up, Bookwalter,
who ran for governor, seized him, and gave him
the direction of the comet which did not know
how it came there, or where it was going. At
all events, he did not get the whirl, and twist,
and buzz out of him in time to find out where
he was, or Mr. Blaine either, or to reform his
purpose and execute it.</p>

<p>It is said Henry Clay’s speeches had the most
effect at the time they were delivered, and that
Daniel Webster’s speeches had more effect a
week afterwards, when people had had time to
think them over, than at the time they were
delivered.</p>

<p>You must combine these views to get at the
truth regarding Mr. Blaine’s speeches. They have
tremendous effect when delivered, and great power
afterward. His illustrations, taken right out of
daily life, would catch and hold the thought,
and illuminate the mind, and make themselves
remembered. They would not let go; like some
of the things that have clung to us through
life, we don’t hold on to them, they hold on
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>A speech we heard from him years ago will
never leave us. It was on the currency question,
which was discussed for years, and, like
Banco’s ghost, would not down.</p>

<p>His first sentence will never be forgotten. It
was characteristic of the man, and expressed a
great principle of his political philosophy. This
was it: “<i>A thing is never settled until it is
settled right.</i>”</p>

<p>How true that was of Slavery! how true of
the currency question! how true of every great
question of moral or religious reform! Until it
is settled right it is like a piece of glass in
the eye, you cannot get it into a comfortable
position; you move it and arrange and re-arrange
it, and think now that it is fixed for certain,
and just as it ceases to vex you,—like the
crooked stick in the fable, so crooked it could
not lie still,—it turns over.</p>

<p>In that same speech,—and it moved and swayed
thousands then, and clings to them yet like an
influence of magic power, moving and swaying
them still, in it was a little simple reference to
experience he had in California, and it was before
specie payments had been resumed, but they
were on a gold basis out on the Pacific coast.
He had gone into a bank to get a check of
three hundred dollars cashed, and he said, “Give
me gold,” and they gave him gold, and he divided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
it up and put it in all his pockets to balance
the load, and he went about the city calling
here and there, going up long stairways, and over
great establishments, and all the while that gold
was getting heavier. He would change it about
and carry some in his hand. It was such a luxury
to have gold and not pay any premium on it.
But finally it was too much for him, and in a sort
of desperation he went back to the bank, and
asked them if they would not give him greenbacks
for that gold, and the man said “Yes,” and
he took the little roll of greenbacks and put it
in his vest-pocket, and was not bothered any
more. He acted out the scene with dramatic
effect. The incident gave all a new love for the
greenback, and less thirst for gold.</p>

<p>It was his delight all through that speech to
get questions from the audience, and so settle
their difficulties by giving them just the information
desired.</p>

<p>His power with an audience lay largely in this
method of questioning. He drew near to them,
or rather drew them near to him, was helpful
and kindly; he would stop in his speech and talk
with anyone in the audience that had sensible
questions to ask, and so was down to earth all
the time, and not up among the clouds “careering
on the gale.” And thus he really did something,
really accomplished it, and so made progress.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
He did not fly any eagle, he did not have
one along.</p>

<p>Some grocer or laboring man in the crowd
asked a question about the revenue on sugar,
which Mr. Blaine did not get at first, and an
aristocrat on the platform said, “O, never mind
him, go on with your speech,” but he had
said “What,” and was eagerly listening to get
the man’s thought, and said quickly to the
honorable gentleman, “Keep still,” and waved his
hand back at him to keep quiet, and he heard
the laboring man’s question fairly, and answered
it, too.</p>

<p>It made all respect him the more, and beside,
that was his speech. It was his way of getting
error out of the mind and truth in. It does
not do much good to shoot off a quantity of
powder out doors. It will make a big flash and
smoke and noise, but what of that; put it in a
cannon behind a ball and give it aim, and then
touch it off, and there will be execution.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine’s method of getting the light into
the people was by getting the dark out; like
the Dutchman who put a window into his barn
to let the dark out, but the same process that
let the dark out, let the light in.</p>

<p>He had gotten this colloquial style, it may be
in congress, or in Yankee land where they “raise
questions.” It is a part of a real live Yankee’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
life-work to ask questions. This is his birthright,
an inheritance of the soil.</p>

<p>But the practice is very prevalent in congress,
where there are a great many lawyers who are
skilled in questioning witnesses, and it is a habit
with them, carried from their practice in the
courts to the halls of legislation; and it is a
very convenient and serviceable habit, as the record
of proceedings clearly shows.</p>

<p>It may be recalled that the campaign of 1864
was prosecuted so effectually that while McClellan
received twenty-one electoral votes, only one
of the eighteen free states voting thus honored
him, namely: New Jersey,—Kentucky and Delaware
joining with her.</p>

<p>The real triumph to Mr. Lincoln was in New
York, and we close this chapter by giving it
in Mr. Blaine’s own words, for it had attracted
his special attention. Horatio Seymour and
Reuben E. Fenton were respectively the Democratic
and Republican candidates for Governor
of New York:—</p>

<p>“Governor Seymour’s speech in the Democratic
convention at Chicago, Aug. 29, 1864, had been
an indictment of the most malignant type against
the administration. The president felt that he
was himself wholly wrong, or Governor Seymour
was wholly wrong, and the people of New York
were to decide which. They rendered their verdict<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
in the election of Reuben E. Fenton to
the governorship by a majority of thousands
over Mr. Seymour. Without that result Mr. Lincoln’s
triumph would have been incomplete.
The victory in the nation,” he adds, “was the
most complete ever achieved in an election that
was seriously contested.”</p>

<small>SECOND TERM IN CONGRESS.</small></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcm.jpg" width="75" height="76" alt="M">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">M</span>R. BLAINE reached home weary in
body, but fresh in spirit, from the
great political war in Massachusetts,
New York, and Pennsylvania, just in
time to cast his ballot the last time for Abraham
Lincoln. He had stumped his own state
from “Kittery to Houlton,” which are the extreme
points in Maine, and had put in about
fifty speeches in the other states,—between one
and two hundred in all. He had confidence in
the result, for he had been near the people and
got their temper and knew the purpose of their
sovereign will in the matter, and so it came,
but with it the reflection that they were only
about five years off from the Dred Scott decision,
and every free state but one voting solid
in the electoral college for the great abolition
president, Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>How dark and infamous, and mysterious, too,
looked the repeal of the Missouri Compromise;
the war with Mexico; the Kansas and Nebraska<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
bill; the proposition to purchase Cuba for purposes
of slavery, and all the political paltroonery
and truckling of honored public men, the trimmers
and time-servers!</p>

<p>But what ruin strewed the pathway to such
triumph! There was not a slave in all the land
now, according to the proclamation, emphatically
endorsed, and the rebellion well-nigh crushed.
The effort had been, it is thought, for the South
to hold out until after the presidential election,
and hope for the defeat of Mr. Lincoln. The
war was over six months after his re-election.</p>

<p>In less than a month after election day, Mr.
Blaine was in his seat in congress (December
5th), and there, also, with a knowledge of the
fact that not only had Mr. Lincoln been re-elected
president, but he himself, also, had been
re-elected to congress, for the election took place
a year before each term expired. How could he
be otherwise than happy regarding the political
outlook of either himself or the nation. He
need have little thought for himself; he had
surely caught at the flood that tide which leads
on to greatness. He was not a coming man,
but one who had already come. His record of
the former session had made him more widely
known, and known in a larger sense. Indeed,
he was every way a larger man; beloved at
home, respected and admired abroad in other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
states, and where his great life-work had so
auspiciously begun—in congress.</p>

<p>The principle of evolution was at work upon
him in its only true sense, just as it operates
in tree and flower, where heaven and earth in
all their vital forces are made tributary to Nature’s
laws of unfolding in the deep processes
of growth upward to perfection.</p>

<p>There had been a wondrous involution from
centuries of great history, according to subtle,
silent laws of hereditary inheritance, in very
blood and life, of tone, and quality, and temper,
and now there is evolved, evoked, just that of
power which tells of kinship with those who
have gone before.</p>

<p>It should not cause surprise that Nature keeps
her treasures, or that the right, the good, the
true, live to confront the wrong, the false, the
bad, with just those elements of a nobler life
that no power can resist.</p>

<p>The people everywhere were singing,—</p>

<p class="center">“Our God is marching on.”</p>

<p>And so he was, in all of truth and right
maintained, in all of good performed.</p>

<p>Never were the good and true remembered in
such hosts as when the nation struggled with
her foes. What mighty ones stepped out of the
chaos of a dismal past into splendid life with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
her! Their name is legion; grand in every
sphere of greatness, and great in every realm
of grandeur. They thought out the nation first;
fought out and forged it in battle-heat, and
hurled it like a thing of life, upon its great
career. It never loses its power to go, to be,
and conquer, bringing ever to the birth, and
upward into strong, armed life those whose great
abilities are her own; her own for defense; her
own for war, living in their lives, powerful in
their strong right arms,—one with them in
destiny. Among that number now, though reckoned
with a multitude, was James G. Blaine.</p>

<p>He surveyed the field for but a single day
after the second session of his first congress
opened,—the thirty-eighth,—and then undid the
mischief of another. It was called the “Gold
bill” in the House, and had simply been offered
and referred to the committee of Ways and
Means, by a Mr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Its substance was, that a dollar note issued
by the Government, declared lawful money and
legal tender, is declared of equal value for all
purposes as gold and silver coin of like denominations.
A contract made payable in coin may
be payable in legal tender, and anyone should
be imprisoned who received a greenback for less
than gold coin was worth, and fined as well.</p>

<p>Gold went up in Wall Street within twenty-four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
hours after the bill was presented, twelve
per cent. Mr. Blaine saw it and moved a reconsideration
of it, sections two, three, five, and six
being the objectional features of the bill. His
speech in support of his motion did not occupy
ten minutes. The author of the bill, Mr. Stevens,
said,—</p>

<p>“My friend from Maine (Mr. Blaine) has an intuitive
way of getting at a great national question,
one that has exercised the thoughts of statesmen
of several countries for many years.” This
in opening; and in closing his speech, he said,—</p>

<p>“How the gentleman from Maine, by his intuitive
knowledge of these things comes to understand
at once what the ablest statesmen of
England took months to mature, I cannot very
well understand. It is a happy inspiration.”</p>

<p>Had he a knowledge of his long years of study,
that it was then twenty-five years since he finished
reciting Plutarch, and but little less than
twenty since his graduation, had he a knowledge
of the strong, determined spirit of mastery which
characterized him in all his work, could he have
read over at that moment the long list of volumes
over which he had poured, had he known
these things, he would not have felt that a
genius of intuition who got at things by inspiration
merely, sat before him, but one with a
genius for the hardest kind of a student’s work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
with intuitions born of high intelligence and inspiration
that comes from conscious strength. No
wonder he was an enigma, a man beyond his
years and place, yet master of the situation.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevens’ motion to table the motion of
Mr. Blaine, failed, fifty-one to sixty-eight, and
then the motion of Mr. Blaine regarding the bill
of Mr. Stevens, carried, seventy-three to fifty-two.
It is interesting to notice, that though the gentleman
did not call up his bill for a solid month,—not
until after the holidays,—and then came in
with an elaborate argument showing the financial
course of England in her war with France in
1793, and then in her war finally with the whole
of continental Europe, though he seemed to have
made a careful study of his subject, and of
England’s financial policy, he closed with this
sentence:—</p>

<p>“I feel that England never had so absurd a
law as to pay one part of her war-debt in gold and
another part in Bank of England notes.” He
said “I feel,” he did not know. But Mr. Blaine
knew, and so he asked him whether the bonds
negotiated by England upon the continent were
not payable in gold.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” was the answer.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Blaine stated, “Every one of them
negotiated upon the continent was payable in
gold, both principal and interest. Every one negotiated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
at the Hague, at Frankfort-on-the-Main,
and elsewhere upon the continent, was negotiated
upon the gold basis exclusively.”</p>

<p>This was no contest to win, but simply to
bring out financial intelligence in a semi-official
way, for the benefit of the country. It was a
most sensitive subject. Gold was up to two
hundred and fifty, that is, a hundred dollars in
gold cost two hundred and fifty dollars in greenbacks,
and Mr. Stevens had endeavored in a
wrong way, as Mr. Brooks showed, to correct
gambling in gold, but Mr. Blaine could furnish
him with deficiencies of knowledge, and manifest
the acumen of a statesman upon a subject so
great.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine had his magnetic power then, and
Mr. Stevens refers to it, and his great power
over the House in securing so promptly the
passage of his motion. He said,</p>

<p>“The House, partaking of the magnetic manner
of my friend from Maine, became alarmed,
and immediately laid the bill on the table.”</p>

<p>It was his power of quick, thrilling action; of
feeling strongly, and making others feel as he
did; of casting upon them the glow of his own
brilliancy; of charming them with the rhapsody
of his own genius; of piercing them with the
energy of his own thinking, and so shutting
them up to his conclusions by the force of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
own arguments; it was thus by methods the
fairest and most honorable to his abilities, that
he carried all before him. And one can but see
in his repeated control of the House, the power
of his friendships.</p>

<p>Cox, Pendleton, Brooks, and others of the opposition
would show him the greatest courtesies
in debate. Randall, even, in his first session,
gave him time out of his own hour for an entire
speech, and Cox encouraged him in the
midst of his Gold bill speech, by saying he was
with him on it.</p>

<p>When the Naval Academy bill was before the
House, he moved to repeal a section relating to
cadets “found deficient.” If they had a hundred
demerit marks in six months they would be expelled.
Mr. Blaine had visited the academy in
1861, as a member of the “Board of Visitors,”
and while there a young man was dismissed, not
for any fault of scholarship, for he was among
the brightest and best in his class.</p>

<p>Becoming deeply interested in the cause of the
young man, he went to Washington and successfully
interceded with the secretary of war, and
he was restored. He subsequently graduated
very high in class-rank, and since his entrance
upon active service has distinguished himself as
an officer of great merit, serving with efficiency
and distinction as ordnance-officer on General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
Sheridan’s staff in that splendid, victorious campaign
in the valley of the Shenandoah.</p>

<p>The demerits were given for singularly small
offences, as: “floor out of order near wash-stand,
four demerits,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine insisted that to the secretary of
war and the president be restored the power
that was taken from them at the last session,—to
pardon any cadet discharged for any of
these offences.</p>

<p>General Schenck joined him, and the amendment
was adopted.</p>

<p>There is a little section of his speech on the
Military Academy bill which shows his admiration
for the telling power of manhood, and his
utter scorn of sacrificing great ability, for which
the nation was so loudly calling then, to little,
simple things, good in themselves, but not of
first importance, that we cannot forbear to give
it. Here it is, verbatim, as he delivered it in
congress:—</p>

<p>“Many of the cadets, sir, who have been very
precise and decorous in their conduct in matters
of petty discipline at the academy, and manage
to pass through smoothly, often graduating with
high rank obtained by very strict attention to
‘folding beds by 10 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>,’ and ‘drawing curtains
by at precisely 6.45 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>’ (academy rules), are
unfortunately never heard from afterwards. Their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
names do not always figure in the record of our
bloody battles, and they have achieved no distinction
in this war, with all its thousand opportunities,
while on the other hand not a few of
the graduates at the academy who at the Point
had the ‘odor of tobacco in their rooms,’ and
whose ‘floors were out of order near the wash-stand,’
have blazoned their names high on the
roll of fame for conduct as gallant and skill as
great as ever graced the battle-fields of any age
country.”</p>

<p>Efficiency has ever been the test with him in
his own work, and this he applies to others;
as one has said, “We measure others in our
own half-bushel; of course we do, we have no
other.”</p>

<p>Early in the session he had a running debate
which tried his metal, with Thayer, of Pennsylvania;
Justin S. Morrill, of Vermont; James S.
Wilson, of Iowa; General Schenck, of Ohio, and
S. S. Cox, of Ohio yielding the floor for the
purpose.</p>

<p>It was not only a proof of his knowledge, but
also of his ability to use it on demand, and he
showed himself equal to the exigency, and
showed that he was generally found away on
the lead in his discussion of constitutional
measures and application of principles.</p>

<p>It is possible for a man to go over, in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
long-winded speech, a vast amount of ground,
which has been tramped as bare as the camp-ground
of a brigade of soldiers, by a multitude
of debaters; ground which has been surveyed,
and staked out, and pre-empted, and owned for
a century or more, and concerning which, as
concerning the constitution there is no question.
Such speeches as these wearied the progressive
spirit of advanced ones, and made them restless
when the fate of great interests hung on the
decision of a few hours’ discussion. No one
watched more closely the utterances of men
upon the floor, or held them to a stricter account.</p>

<p>In presenting a minority report on amendment
of rules for the government of the House, Mr.
Morrill had placed some undue restriction upon
the powers of congress, and courteously waiting
until he had finished a long speech of ten or
eleven columns, Mr. Blaine asked him whether
the power of impeachment would not extend to
cabinet officers, and so their attendance upon the
sittings of the House be compelled, a point Mr.
Morrill had denied.</p>

<p>There had been little demand for this power
slumbering in the constitution,—power which was
used upon a president shortly afterward,—but
brought prominently to the attention of the
House, and much light thrown on it by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
answers tersely given to near a score of questions,
members were pleased to ask Mr. Blaine,
and while he was ready with abundant answers;
clear and strong, and packed with knowledge of
the highest legal type, he was ready as well if
there was hint of an assailant in manner or
tone, to thrust out a sharp, rising question which
would almost take the breath of the man who
might be after him. When General Schenck asked
him if the secretary of war was a civil officer,
his quick reply was, “I do not think that a
‘civil’ question.” Neither was it, for as member
of the cabinet of course he was a civil officer,
as much so as the president himself, who
was by virtue of his office “Commander-in-chief
of the armies of the Union.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Blaine had great respect for age and
learning, and allowed no opportunity to show it
to pass by unimproved. His early intercourse
with his Grandfather Gillespie had developed
largely veneration both for gray hairs and
scholarly attainments, a veneration which had
matured by associations with his teachers and
great men of the nation whom he had met in
his youthful days, and those whom he had since
come to know and honor.</p>

<p>When Mr. Henry Winter Davis came on with
his great naval speech, Mr. Blaine heard him
with special pleasure, and had some very complimentary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
things to say of “the caustic, scathing,
truthful, and deserved criticism of the naval department
in building,” as Mr. Blaine said,
“twenty iron-clad vessels, at a cost of ten millions
of dollars, that will not stay on top of
water.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pike had just taken him to task for this
last statement, when the “hammer fell,” and Mr.
Davis, showing his appreciation of the courtesies
of Mr. Blaine, arose and said, “I ask unanimous
consent that the gentleman from Maine may be
permitted to proceed.” This was indeed a consideration
which young members seldom received
from the veterans of the House, and especially
from one with a national reputation for scholarly
attainments. But as “the debate in Committee
of the Whole was closed by order of the House,”
the Chair could not grant the request, and just
here Mr. Blaine’s shrewdness and intimate knowledge
of parliamentary rules showed itself. “I
move,” he said, “to amend the amendment, by
striking out the first line; that will entitle me
to the floor for a few minutes longer.”</p>

<p>Then he went on to give an official fact, as
he called it, and he knew well the value of such
things; there was nothing “fine-spun” about
them, but strong and stubborn, and full of power
to convince. “Out of ninety British steamers,”
he said, “caught within a given period in attempting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
to run the blockade, only twelve were
caught by vessels built by the present administration
of the navy department; while seventy-eight
were caught either by purchased vessels,
or vessels inherited from the old navy. I submit,
sir, that this fact bears with crushing force
on the practical question of the speed and efficiency
of vessels of the new navy.” It is bad
enough to swindle the government at any time,
and in any thing, but in times of war to swindle
her in the construction of iron-clad vessels
that will not float, yet needed at once for active
service, and produce twenty of them at half a
million dollars apiece, was enough to arouse the
indignation not only of the older member, Mr.
Davis, but also of the younger man, Mr. Blaine.</p>

<p>And this now gave him a new, fresh start,
untrammeled by crutch or cane, casting him wholly
upon his own resources, and placing him where
he must put forth all the power in him, or utterly
fail.</p>

<p>“When the Jeannette went down, crushed and
sunken by the ice,” writes Lieutenant Danenhouser,
“we started with our boats southward,
dragging them over the ice, broken and piled in
every conceivable shape. We accomplished seven
miles the first week, only to find, by taking
observations, that the ice-floe had drifted us
back to the northward twenty-seven miles, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
so placing us twenty miles to the rear of the
spot where we had started, and our ship had
sunk.” They had intrepid spirits, but no firm
ground; he had both the intrepid spirit and the
firm ground on which to stand, and his victory
was swift and certain.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine never lost an opportunity to do a
favor, or make a friend. Doing duty was his
delight; getting hold of strong, plain, practical
facts, and presenting them in a way that showed
a constant, abiding interest in his constituency, that
he was living and toiling for them, and had
their best interest, and those of the entire state
of Maine, and the whole country at heart.</p>

<p>Here is one of his plain, practical statements,
showing his loyalty to home interests, as well
as the business interests of the country. A vessel
from his district had been chartered to government
to carry a cargo of four hundred and fifty
tons of coal from Philadelphia to New Orleans,
for six thousand dollars. Upon her return her
disbursements had been six thousand, two hundred
and thirty-eight dollars and five cents.
She received six thousand dollars in certificates
of indebtedness from the government, then selling
them at ninety-four, which made but five
thousand six hundred and forty dollars in cash,
showing a net cash loss of five hundred and
ninety-eight dollars and five cents, besides the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
interest on advance, about two hundred dollars
more.</p>

<p>“And now, sir,” said Mr. Blaine, “after this
melancholy experience the tax-collector came forward
and demanded of the owner of the vessel,
two and one-half per cent. on the six thousand
dollars which the government paid, as above,
and on top of all losses already incurred actually
compelled him to pay one hundred and fifty
dollars under that section of the internal-revenue
law, which we are seeking to amend.</p>

<p>“A man’s profit in business,” he goes on to
say, “affords a fair basis of taxation, but it is
a cruel mockery of one’s misfortune to assess a
tax upon losses.”</p>

<p>He further plead that “as commercial men of
the country, who do so much to sustain our
finances and our honor, they should be relieved
from its oppressive exactions.”</p>

<p>There were no mists or fogs about him to
conceal him or his methods, and what he said
stood out in the clear light of day. In this
case he was able to catch up from memory, a
better argument for the repeal of the oppressive
section of the law than had come to the House
in a lengthy written memorial from a company
doing business on the Schuylkill Canal in Pennsylvania,
and who could make sitings net them
four hundred and ten dollars, while in the case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
cited by Mr. Blaine, one trip was made at a
loss of nine hundred and forty-eight dollars and
five cents.</p>

<p>Seldom did he cite his own opinion. It was
the bludgeon of hard, solid facts with which he
did his best execution. Others might theorize,
and imagine, and conceive, and spin web after
web of sophistry, like the spider, out of themselves,
to be full as flimsy when the storm of
debate beat upon it, but not he. He evidently
kept up a living acquaintance with those to
whom he was responsible, and this, with an
ever vigilant correspondence, enabled him to
know, and not simply think and feel, but actually
to know their adverse experiences where
the operations of the machinery of government
affected them, and with reasonable and apparent
facts in hand he could easily procure the remedy.
This lively interest, so practical and so potent
as well, was with him a constant element of
power.</p>

<p>He lost no opportunity to familiarize himself
with business enterprises, great and small, and
get the best authority on all questions of finance
and trade, and as a result he could speak with
pertinency, and from a mind prolific of the freshest
data on the practical questions as they were
constantly coming before the House, and especially
in the old war-days, when the vexed questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
of internal revenue, with all its myriad
details regarding the nature and value of taxable
articles, were being adjusted.</p>

<p>At one time when he first entered congress,
nearly every article that entered into the construction
of a ship was taxed, and then upon
her tonnage, and then, beside, upon the gross
receipts for carrying the cargo. He saw to it
at once that those matters were attended to.</p>

<p>But a fresh call was out for troops, and it
was a final call. They were getting ready for
the great opening of the spring campaign which
was to speedily end in crushing the Rebellion,
and annihilating the Confederacy. There was a
flaw in the enrollment law passed the last session,
which Mr. Blaine had discovered, and
sought to remedy. It permitted recruiting in
the rebel states, and credits for previous naval
enlistments. “From these two sources have
arisen the gigantic and wide-spread evil of filling
quotas of towns without adding troops to the
army.” He had offered an amendment which was
designed to bring back recruiting to “an honest,
meritorious, and patriotic effort to fill the
ranks of our gallant army with men, and not
with shadowy fictions which pass under the
name of ‘paper credits.’” The quotas of entire
cities, districts, and possibly states, had been
thus filled “without adding a single man or musket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
to the effective military force of the nation.
There was fraud, and he would so change the
law that it could not be perpetuated.”</p>

<p>There were substitute-brokers, who, in some
mysterious way, would get hold of these “credits,”
as they were called, and sell them, much
as torn scrip is sold.</p>

<p>“We can deal just by the government,” he
said, “in its struggle for existence. It calls for
men, and it is worse than madness to answer
this call with anything else than men.</p>

<p>“In conclusion,” and his words reveal a genuine
patriotism and zeal of affection for the soldier,
“nothing so discourages the brave men at
the front as the belief that proper measures are
not adopted at home for re-enforcing and sustaining
them.</p>

<p>“After four years of such patriotic and heroic
effort for national unity as the world has never
witnessed before, we cannot now afford to have
the great cause injured, or its fair fame darkened
by a single unworthy incident connected
with it. The improper practices of individuals
cannot disgrace and degrade the nation, but
after these practices are brought to the attention
of congress, we shall assuredly be disgraced
and degraded if we fail to apply the remedy.
Let us, then, in this hour of the national need,
do our duty here, our duty to the troops in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
field, our duty to our constituents at home, and
our country; above all, to our country, whose
existence has been in such peril in the past,
but whose future of greatness and glory seems
now so assured, and so radiant.”</p>

<p>Few utterances of those long, dark years,
breathed a spirit of more devoted loyalty than
is found even in these few sentences, and they
were uttered when they would do the most
good, and secure just those re-enforcements that
would gladden the hearts of veterans, and hasten
the end of the struggle.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine had a keen eye for fraud, and
made it his business to detect it; and he was
just fearless enough to hold it up to the light
of day. Wherever he unearthed it he would
point out the individual, and point his finger at
him and say, with a boldness known only to
invective and scorn, “Thou art the man!”</p>

<p>He never seemed to take care of his popularity,
but of his constituents and of his country.
Enemies abounded, and evil, and wrong;
and to these he paid effective attention, rightly
judging that no course is safer, or accords with
fuller satisfaction, than the right course. With
him, character was the citadel of strength and
influence; and so we find him knowing and
trusting himself, reaching for wrong in all of
its strongholds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>And there was much to encourage now
Sherman had reached the sea; Columbia, S. C.,
was captured; Charleston was evacuated; the
old flag was again flying over Fort Sumter,
and Washington’s Birthday was to be celebrated,
by order of the secretary of war, E. M.
Stanton, by a “national salute at West Point,
and at every fort, arsenal, and army head-quarters
of the United States, in honor of the
event.” This twenty-second day of February was
a long, busy day in congress. It was a quarter
past five before the House adjourned. Mr.
Blaine was in his seat all day long, voting
steadily for the right and against the wrong.
The conquered states, cut off from the Rebellion
and rescued to liberty and lawful authority, were
left without government, and must be provided,
as Tennessee had been in the person of Andrew
Johnson, now vice-president, with provisional
governors. Much legislation was requisite. Every
man in congress who had ever had any pro-slavery
proclivities, was in his place contesting
every step of progress with men who had never
breathed aught but the air of freedom and
known only loyal heart-beats.</p>

<p>One bill granted citizenship to all colored men
who had served in the army and navy.</p>

<p>Right royal work, this, for such a man
to be doing on a day so sacred; helping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
into citizenship the colored man, ever loyal,
ever true.</p>

<p>This seemed to be the great feature of all
the great bills before the House that day. It
came up in the bill to encourage enlistments,
and the worth and dignity of being an American
citizen was held up before the negro as a
prize for him to win; as something in store for
him in the future; and so as giving to the
colored troops, and all who united with them,
this personal interest in relation to the government.
But it takes time to get such thoughts
adjusted to minds struggling with the fact of
Emancipation, and so little is done but give the
bills a hearing and pass them to another reading.
Coming events had cast their shadows before
them. It was, however, but the shadow of
a passing cloud, and told of a great, bright sun
shining in the heavens yonder, which would soon
dissipate all clouds and shadows, and the long
night of bondage ended, give a glorious day, in
which the world might see in the poorest black
man of the South an American citizen, possessed
of certain inalienable rights, among which are
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>

<p>To the happy consummation of a task so
grand, whose inspiration comes from that free
and holy place where “all are one,” Mr. Blaine
had set his hand, only to remove it when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
chaplet of America’s proudest, noblest glory was
on the black man’s brow.</p>

<p>That life is most divine which is most in
line with Providence, and has the most of uplifting
power in it, which stands the highest up,
and can reach the farthest down, is many-handed
in its helpfulness, and strong-handed as
well, to unshackle humanity in body, in soul, and
in spirit, and tell the fallen or sunken ones how
to get upward toward God and heaven.</p>

<p>Opening the gates of heaven means unlocking
the gates of earth, and to this latter task the
statesmen of the nation stood pledged from
that day, since numbered among the nation’s
holidays. A close student of Mr. Blaine’s congressional
career will be impressed with the fact
that it seems planned and determined before-hand.
There are no surprises in it. He seems
to have determined upon his course before entering
it, and gives his strength to certain measures,
and does not fritter it away upon every
resolve, or amendment, or motion, that happens
to be before the House, affecting some far away
interest of a day-dreamer.</p>

<p>He recognizes the fact fully that he is one of
a great body of men, each one of whom is
charged with interests of an important character
to their state or district, and many heavily
weighted with special and peculiar measures of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
national importance. These must all have their
opportunity. Less than ninety working-days usually
comprise the session, and there are but
four of these in a congress,—from March to adjournment,
and from December to March, and
then repeated, constitutes a congressional term,
with eight of them in a presidential term, or
two a year for the four years. Beside, it takes
so long a time to get measures through congress
that the successful man finds it necessary to devote
himself with great carefulness to the few
measures of importance he would have adopted,
and become law organic or otherwise.</p>

<p>Very soon after Mr. Blaine entered congress
he presented a resolution instructing the Committee
on Judiciary to inquire into the expediency
of amending the constitution so as to allow
congress to levy an export tax. But the session
closed, and it is not reported, and now his second
session is closing, and still it is not forthcoming.
Why not? He will know the reason
why! And so there comes a day near the session’s
close, only the day before Mr. Lincoln’s
second inauguration, when he arises and states
“a little grievance.” He states the resolution,
its being offered at the last session, and now
again at the present session. It had been to the
Ways and Means Committee, to which it had
been transferred. Evidently he had been ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
to grapple with the subject for some time, and
proceeded to do so. It involved an amendment
to the constitution, and one “essential to the
financial success of the government, and to the
agricultural, commercial, and manufacturing prosperity
of the country in all future time.”</p>

<p>It was stated that the measure would have
been presented by the committee, if they had
supposed time would have permitted of its consideration.
It presented a subject that was discussed
at length in the Convention of 1787.
The “Madison Papers” give a synopsis of the
constitutional debates of that convention, and
show that many of the strongest men of that
body, the really far-sighted ones, opposed the
insertion of the clause prohibiting a tax on exports.
The vote was not a very decisive one,
nor did its advocacy come from the Southern
or “staple states,” and opposition from Northern
states.</p>

<p>He proceeds to deliver what is his great
speech, if not the great speech of the session.
It was probably not over an hour long, but he
had not proceeded far before it became apparent
that he had thoroughly studied the subject, and
was investing it with a new interest.</p>

<p>A great debt of more than two billion eight
hundred million was on the nation. Mr. Blaine’s
amendment was looking towards its liquidation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
It was the wise, strong look far ahead. He saw
in it several hundred millions of revenue in the
export of cotton, tobacco, and naval stores, without
affecting the demand for them, and also in
petroleum, and numberless articles, still more of
revenue. France was taxing her wines and brandies,
and countries having peculiar commodities
taxed them.</p>

<p>Cotton which sold in Liverpool at eleven and
three-quarters pence per pound in December,
1861, sold for twenty-four and one-half pence
per pound in just one year from that date.
The three million two hundred thousand bales
of five hundred pounds each, this country had
exported, were missed there.</p>

<p>“Whoever as secretary of the treasury shall
undertake and succeed in paying the debt,” he
argues in closing, “must have open to him the
three great avenues of taxation, namely, the
tariff, the excise system, and the duties on exports,
and must be empowered to use each in its
appropriate place, by congressional legislation.”</p>

<p>And so he closed the first half of his second
congressional year, with the same policy of questions
with which he began, aiming still at thoroughness
and mastery, still the guiding stars of
his history, the moulding powers and the prominent
features of his great career.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dci.jpg" width="77" height="75" alt="I">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>T is Inauguration Day in Washington.
Not McClellan,—he is in Europe,—but
Lincoln is to be inaugurated. It is a
day of wondrous glory to him, and to
the nation, but one so oppressed with the cares
of state has but little joy in it. There is no
retiring president to sign all the tardy bills of
an expiring congress. He must do it all, and
then go from the realizations of the past to the
unknown of the new. There was no instant of
rest for him between laying off the armor and
putting it on anew.</p>

<p>Of all the many thousand eyes that looked
on him that day, none were more brilliant with
the look of praise, none gleamed with a soul-light
more fervent, none took in the scene with
deeper thoughts of the hour or the future, oppressive
with interest, than Mr. Blaine.</p>

<p>Little did he dream of twenty years to come.
He had thought to scale the centuries as they
stood like silent statues in the sombre, shadowy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
past, and read out the hieroglyphics of their
history. But just as the rebellion was broken,
shattered, staggering to its fall, and seemed
certain, and was scarce hung about with doubt,
so now to faith the future is bright and clear,
while hope is strong and almost gay with vivid
anticipations.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine was profoundly impressed with the
religious character of Abraham Lincoln, as exemplified
in the tone of his public documents.</p>

<p>He says: “Throughout the whole period of the
war he constantly directed the attention of the
nation to dependence on God. It may indeed
be doubted whether he omitted this in a single
state paper. In every message to congress, in
every proclamation to the people, he made it
prominent. In July, 1863, after the battle of
Gettysburgh, he called upon the people to give
thanks because ‘it has pleased Almighty God to
hearken to the supplications and prayers of an
afflicted people, and to vouchsafe signal and effective
victories to the army and navy of the
United States,’ and he asked the people ‘to render
homage to the Divine Majesty and to invoke
the influence of His Holy Spirit to subdue the
anger which has produced and so long sustained
a needless and cruel rebellion.’”</p>

<p>“On another occasion,” writes Mr. Blaine, “recounting
the blessings which had come to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
Union, he said: ‘No human counsel hath devised,
nor hath any mortal hand worked out these
great things. They are the gracious gifts of the
Most High God, who, while dealing with us in
anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered
mercy.’ Throughout his entire official career, attended
at all times with exacting duty and painful
responsibility, he never forgot his own dependence
unto the same authority, or the dependence
of the people upon a Higher Power.” And
then he quotes those words of the great man,
uttered reverently to the people assembled in
crowds to congratulate him upon the return of
peace: “In the midst of your joyous expressions,
He from whom all blessings flow must first be
remembered.”</p>

<p>His last inaugural, delivered but a little while
before this final utterance, was in keeping with it.
It was a deeply religious document, referring to
no political measure or material interest, and in
six days after the people crowd about him, full
of joy at the close of the war, the bullet of
the assassin is in his brain! What a week
was that in which the war closed, and the
great Lincoln was murdered! And what a summer
was that, when the broken armies came
marching home, halting in Washington for the
great review!</p>

<p>But a campaign is on Mr. Blaine, and he hurries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
home. For the third time Samuel Coney is
elected governor, and Mr. Blaine has again done
his work well. Autumn passes, and he is in his
place at the opening of the thirty-ninth congress.
With his usual unforgetfulness, he resumes
connection with a bill presented by him
in the early part of the previous congress, for
reimbursing the loyal states for war-expenses
in response to the president’s call for troops.
His bill is very explicit, and shows that during
the long delay he had perfected it in its details.
No flaw is found in it, no amendment is made
to it, but it is at once referred, upon his motion,
to a select committee of seven, and upon
his motion he demands the previous question, so
that the matter shall be attended to at once. The
bill was read a first and second time, and so
referred.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine is of course upon the committee,
and by his motion members are added to it,
and they are empowered to hire a clerk. What
a work to examine and pass upon all the war-debts
of the loyal states! A grave question
soon makes its appearance in congress. In undoing
the legislation of years, enacted in the interests
of slavery, they have come to the basis
of representation. The slave is not yet a citizen,
and if the basis is population and not suffrage,
the South will have an immense advantage,—indeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
an advantage similar to that enjoyed before
the war, when, though slaves were expressly
recognized as chattels, and according to the Dred
Scott decision, “a black man had no rights a
white man was bound to respect,” yet, according
to slavery law five of them gave their master
three extra votes.</p>

<p>But the ratio of voters to population varied
from nineteen to fifty-eight per cent. in different
states, as, for example, California had two
hundred and seven thousand voters out of a
population of three hundred and fifty-eight thousand
one hundred and ten, while Vermont had
but eighty-seven thousand voters out of a population
of three hundred and fourteen thousand
three hundred and sixty-nine, and each had
three representatives in congress; that is, eighty-seven
thousand voters in Vermont sent three
congressmen, while two hundred and seven thousand
voters in California sent but the same
number.</p>

<p>There were more women and children in Vermont,
two to one, than in California, and so in
the latter state there were more than twice as
many voters in the same population.</p>

<p>It was with such arguments as the above,—a
mathematical argument, without sophistry, and
that cannot be impeached,—that he opposed a
constitutional amendment making suffrage and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
not population the basis of representation, and
so reserving an argument to use in framing the
citizenship of the freemen.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine has long been noted for the great
rapidity with which he works.</p>

<p>He very soon has an immense report from
his committee of nine, to pay the loyal states
their war-claims. In it twenty-six states, five
territories, and the District of Columbia have
their war-claims adjusted, and they are to receive
all the way from nine thousand nine hundred
and fifty-five dollars, as in the case of the
territory of Dakota for enlisting one hundred
and eighty-one men, up to twenty million nine
hundred and ninety-three thousand two hundred
and eighty dollars, as in the case of New York
for enlisting three hundred and eighty-one thousand
six hundred and ninety-six men; and it is
a peculiarity with him to know for himself, by
careful computation, the exact truth of the statistics
he employs.</p>

<p>One day it so happened that he used the
calculations of a distinguished member who was
chairman of a prominent committee,—that of
ways and means,—and they were called in
question; but soon after he was able to affirm
publicly that they were correct.</p>

<p>There was such a charm in being right and
knowing it, despite all contradiction, that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
could not forego the pleasure, the very confidence
and self-respect, even at the expense of
perplexing effort. A point of order was raised
against him one day; his instant reply was,
“That point was raised exactly ten years ago
and overruled,” and the chair ruled in harmony
with his remembrance.</p>

<p>His great love for mathematics, and the position
he was in requiring it, he was led to
make an extensive study of the history of
finance, and in a speech of great length, by
which he supported his report to pay the vast
war-claims of the loyal states, he clearly shows
the wide range of his acquaintance with the
subject. He shows great familiarity with the
policy and utterances of Alexander Hamilton,
his exceeding common-sense methods, which he
quotes with so great aptness as to give them
the power of living arguments, as he offers
them in evidence of the wisdom of his own
views and the tenable nature of the positions
he has taken.</p>

<p>It was proposed to bring all troops to a
three years’ basis, and then refund at the rate
of fifty-five dollars a man. Thus, Pennsylvania,
with three hundred and sixty-six thousand three
hundred and twenty-six men, which, reduced to
a three years’ basis, gave two hundred and sixty-seven
thousand five hundred and fifty-eight, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
at the rate proposed made the claim of that
state fourteen million seven hundred and fifteen
thousand six hundred and ninety dollars. The
Gettysburgh battle alone had cost the state
seven hundred thousand dollars, and as for that
and other service she had furnished men for a
much shorter period than three years, the whole
number of men were reduced nearly one hundred
thousand to get them all on the three
years’ basis.</p>

<p>No question commanded a more wide-spread
or deeper attention for years subsequent to the
war than the question of money, and it behooved
any man with the aspirations of a statesman, to
make a long and thorough study of it.</p>

<p>“Reading,” it is said, “makes a full man,
speaking a ready man.” He was both reader
and speaker, and so proved the truth of the
maxim, by being both a full and a ready man;
and he never allowed himself to get empty.
It was the knowledge of the day, most valuable
to him, with which he was filled, as well as
that which came from historical research.</p>

<p>It was about this time that, as a member of
the committee on military affairs, and while the
conduct of the office of provost-marshal general
was being investigated, that he had his lively
tilt with Mr. Roscoe Conkling, and brought out
all of his powers of wit and sarcasm, showing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
him more than a match for the gentleman. It
was undoubtedly the most brilliant intellectual
contest of the session. Ex-Governor Morrill says,
“It was a pretty lively time, but they were
boys then, and probably are better friends to-day,
though it is certainly evident they both did
their best.”</p>

<p>Consistency in legislation seemed a law with
Mr. Blaine, so that the House should not be
found contradicting itself on the military functions
of the president. Indeed the powers of
government are so nicely balanced between the
executive and the Senate and House, that great
watchfulness is needed that there be no conflict;
and new members,—and sometimes old members,—are
found transgressing legitimate bounds.
For instance, there was a section to a bill that
“until the fourth day of July, in the year 1870,
all persons who voluntarily adhered to the late
insurrection, giving it aid and comfort, shall be excluded
from the right to vote for representatives
in congress, and for elections for president and
vice-president of the United States.” He at once
raised the question of bad faith, because on
July 17, 1862, they had authorized the president
to grant pardon and amnesty to any person,
state or part thereof, that was in rebellion.</p>

<p>And to this effect President Lincoln did issue
a proclamation, and hundreds, and perhaps thousands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
of pardons were granted. And in 1865
President Johnson issued his celebrated amnesty
proclamation, pardoning all below the military
rank of colonel, who had participated in the
Rebellion, excepting certain classes.</p>

<p>One thing is clearly manifest in all of Mr.
Blaine’s operations in congress,—he thoroughly
enjoys it all; he is at home, and feels so constantly.
He can trust himself; there is no striving
for effect. He never gets lost in depths,
nor aground upon shallows. He can fish in deep
water, or seine near shore. It is quite noticeable
how he will go with the passage of a
motion from some minor detail of internal revenue
to the gravest questions of constitutional
law. It was said once by a great preacher who
was pastor of a large church, editor of a large
paper, and engaged in writing a book, that he
had to live in those three great spheres, transporting
himself daily from one to another, as he
worked in each. But here were not less than a
dozen great departments with which one must
be as familiar as with the rooms of his dwelling,
and have in possession, living, present, trenchant
facts; the latest phases of new, fresh life,
and the old and musty as well. For it will not
do to blunder in congress; it is blundering before
the nation, and before the world. The
folks at home will find it out right off, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
worst of all <i>you</i> will find it out, and a man
will feel so terribly small, and ashamed, and
mean, and it will be such desperate hard work
to own up, and sit down with all-hands looking
straight at you.</p>

<p>It is one of the first matters of congressional
courtesy, to let anyone ask you a question.
And this is all done so blandly, and in such
elegant diction, one is almost charmed by the
tones so as scarcely to get hold of the question
itself; but that question is like the bee, so
bright and beautiful, and musical withal, and
yet it has a sting.</p>

<p>What is denominated “brass,” in modern parlance,
will not serve one’s purpose. It is at
once detected by its sound, and then confusion
comes,—it will come, it must come, and brass
cannot prevent it.</p>

<p>The present was a long, tedious term, and
kept the members well into the summer. The
internal-revenue laws must be properly adjusted;
the army re-organized; settlers were pouring,
by the thousand, and actually by the hundred
thousand, into the great region between the Missouri
and the Pacific,—so much so that the
lieutenant-general urges congress to provide the
means requisite for their protection, as a great
body of citizens who are filling up the country,
rendering it productive, and erecting states; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
beside these, a multitude of other things are
demanding attention.</p>

<p>And then, after adjournment, comes the great
campaign, in which the thirteenth amendment is
submitted to the suffrage of the people. Two-thirds
of the states must endorse it to make it
organic law, and this they do right heartily, and
congress resumes its session the first Monday
in December. It is the second session of the
thirty-ninth congress, and the second of Mr.
Blaine’s second term.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine had a very eligible seat, at the
left of the speaker, and well in front; almost
within reach of him sat Garfield.</p>

<p>The first day of the session Mr. Blaine made
a move for the repeal of the three cents per
pound tax on raw cotton, which was finally carried.
This was a move which affected every
home, and especially the laboring classes; for
older ones do not forget how enormously high
cotton goods were in war times and subsequently,
and so have little difficulty in understanding the
importance of such a move. It was contended
that it was a wrong principle to tax the raw
production of the soil, and in conflict with the
long-established policy of the nation.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine’s resolves at this time came thick
and fast, like resolutions at New Year’s, but
with more purpose in them. Indeed his purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
is a noticeable feature of every move, and he
could state it in the plainest kind of English,
and it was his practice, after a bill was read,
or resolution presented, to state its meaning,
tell just what he meant by it, as the legal
forms do not always make it at once apparent.
He gives his reasons for the measure. For instance,
volunteer officers could not be breveted
in the regular army for meritorious service in
the volunteer service. This he saw was wrong,
and drew up a bill in regular form to right
the matter, and then states what he means
about it, and the facts that have moved him,
generally move the rest. Almost nine-tenths of
the new regular army was to be made up
of the old volunteers, and he would have the
old regular army laws changed so as not to discriminate
against them and in favor of West
Pointers.</p>

<p>There was no red-tape about him. He did
not believe in it. It took too much time, and
was too unjust. He believed in solid worth,
and in rewarding it. He is a straight and constant
American, and loves all who love America,
and will not have them dealt unfairly with if it
is in his power to prevent. Fair play is a term
he often used during his early terms in congress.
It seemed to express his ideal of honor.
An unfair man was not respectable in his eyes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
It was a right upon which he strenuously insisted
for himself. He evidently had seen the
old definition of freeman, “Who knows his rights
and knowing dare maintain.”</p>

<p>And yet this genius of fair play which possessed
him, kept him from being a bigot. His
sense of justice would rebel against an outrage
inflicted upon anyone. But it is getting to be a
hot place in congress. Andrew Johnson has disappointed
the hopes of the nation. He is not
filling the place of the dead Lincoln, but rather
dishonoring it, and articles of impeachment are
originating in the House, summoning him before
the bar of the senate because of “the crimes
and high misdemeanors of which he is manifestly
and notoriously guilty, and which render it unsafe
longer to permit him to exercise the functions
he has unlawfully assumed.” The air was
filled with this matter of impeachment during the
summer campaign, but on in the dead of winter
there is no disposition to rush madly or blindly
into it. It is but one of many things demanding
attention.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine is as conservative as he is radical.
He combines in a very strong and decided manner
many of the best characteristics of both. He
does not rush into everything that comes before
the House, but calmly surveys and studies,
and comes to know the question in its bearings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
and reaches conclusions, and with these truly
gained and firmly held, he is ready for action.</p>

<p>The novelty of a thing makes him suspicious;
he must know it through and through, for when
he begins he will surely end. One comes to expect
that when he presses a measure it will pass,
and however much there may be to retard its
progress, he will never lose sight of it until it
goes through.</p>

<p>It seemed to be a time of political apostasy
in the nation. Many are betraying their trusts,
and a large number fall, politically, to rise no
more. Many of the old war Democrats, like
Andrew Johnson, were simply Democrats when
the war was over. It seemed to be a sort of
political reaction after the high pressure of the
war. They were not prepared to accept all the
results of the war. It was more than they had
anticipated, and the result was an unwillingness to
proceed, and so many called a halt; but Thaddeus
Stevens in the House, and Charles Sumner in the
senate, kept the work planned and the forces in
motion. Mr. Stevens formed a strong friendship
for Mr. Blaine, and as they were on the military
committee together, he learned to respect
his talents and prize his ability.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE 4th of March comes, and with
it the fortieth congress, with Schuyler
Colfax, of Indiana, still in the
speaker’s chair; Rutherford B. Hayes,
James A. Garfield, and James G. Blaine are in
the House. They were on their way up to the
nation’s honors, and had seats near each other.
The House, rather than the senate, is the place
to look for presidents. There seems to be no
special reason for it, unless it is that senatorial
dignity and greatness are less approachable, not
so easily grasped by the public mind, and farther
away from the great masses of the people.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine comes to the fortieth congress
with the same soldierly spirit of fearlessness, the
same scholarly spirit of intelligence, the same
genial spirit of friendship, that have borne him
through two former terms in Washington. He is
now recognized as an adept in parliamentary law,
and is put on with the speaker, Mr. Washburne,
and others to revise the rules of the House,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
and is found reporting rule after rule for
adoption. He is fairly in training now for the
speakership, but before that can come he must
be re-elected, and he has already been elected
twice by way of compliment, as it is termed in
Maine. But he is no dreamer, and so devotes
himself to business, with enough to do, and no
idle hours. He is quite methodical, and is
heard frequently insisting upon the regular order
of business, and that business on the speaker’s
stand be attended to, and also that members
attend the evening sessions for business. It
worries him to see business of importance drag,
and bills accumulate, and so the House get
behind in its work. He uses every parliamentary
method to prevent delays, and seldom is
his way hedged up effectually when he has determined
upon his course, and feels that fidelity
to his trust requires expedition. He usually
gets through without much opposition, for good
nature in him begets it in others, and so when
all are thus made willing, as by an opposite
disposition they are made unwilling, it is an
easy matter. But when the measure is at all
political, as are some of the great measures
which crystalize the war-victories into constitutional
enactments, he is put upon his resources
for ways and means, and is found usually to be
as fertile as the occasion demands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>He is down in the Record as an editor, and
this places him in relations of sympathy and
friendship with journalists at the capital. He
is known, and knows them, and shows by
the favor of various acts of kindness that his
editorial heart is still beating warm for the
drivers of the quill. There are but three
other editors besides himself in the House,—James
Brooks, of New York city; Lawrence J.
Getz, of Reading; and Adam J. Glassbremer, of
York, Penn.</p>

<p>Gen. John A. Logan sits near enough to Mr.
Blaine for them to get well acquainted, and they
are soon found speaking upon the same question
of appropriating seventy-five thousand dollars to
purchase seed-corn for the South.</p>

<p>It is certainly a matter of peculiar interest to
look in upon these men and see them at their
work, all unconscious of the great future that
lies before them; some of the time doing what
seems like little things, as when Mr. Blaine
moves “to exempt wrapping paper made from
wood from internal tax,” and Mr. Garfield rises
and says, “I ask the gentleman from Maine to
allow an amendment by inserting the word ‘corn-stalks,’
which,” he added, “was a very important
manufacture.” But all of these little things
were part of the great internal-revenue tax bill,
which was to bring millions into the treasury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
of the nation, and so support the government,
and pay the war-debt.</p>

<p>The impeachment resolutions were having a
history in the House, and a reference to them
brings out one fact very conclusively,—that Mr.
Blaine was not hot-headed in the sense of rashness.
Many were at this time,—about a year
before the impeachment trial,—filled with alarm,
excited, aroused, and bent upon the work at
once; but Mr. Blaine was cool, attentive, collected,
and studious of the great subject, and
he saw that as yet the country did not demand
it, and so he moved, the senate concurring,
“That when the House adjourn, on Tuesday
next, it be to meet on Monday, November 11,
at twelve o’clock, <span class="allsmcap">M.</span>” Some six months would
intervene, and many objected. General Butler
was there, and offered a vigorous protest. He
was for war, vigorous, uncompromising, and merciless.
But Mr. Blaine replied, “I would ask the
gentleman from Massachusetts, through what convention
of the people, through what organism of
public opinion, through what channel of general
information anywhere throughout the length and
breadth of the land, this demand is made upon
congress? [It was then March 23, 1867.] Sir,
I maintain that out of the seventeen or eighteen
hundred newspapers that represent the loyal
Union party of this country,—and these are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
the best indices of public opinion which a
party has,—the gentleman cannot find twenty-five
which regard the impeachment movement
as one seriously to be undertaken on the part
of congress at this time.”</p>

<p>It is exceedingly difficult for us now to go
back to a year before the extraordinary spectacle
of an impeachment trial of the President of the
United States, and recall all the circumstances
and the state of the country at that particular
time. The best minds in the House seemed to
be with Mr. Blaine in his feeling, that there was
no immediate demand or warrant for the impeachment
of the president. His acts were public,
and known to the people, and from them
to their representatives in congress must come
the demand. Moreover, the resolutions of impeachment
had been in the hands of a special
committee for some months, but they, agreeing
with Mr. Blaine, saw no cause for impetuous
action.</p>

<p>It was evidently designed to be a matter of
wholesome restraint, that this preliminary step
had been taken. A great many speeches were
made under the resolution to adjourn, upon the
impeachment question.</p>

<p>Mr. Garfield said, “The gentleman said I
desired congress to remain in session for two
reasons; first, to compel the appointment of certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
persons to office [there were several hundred
postmasters to be appointed and confirmed],
and second, for the purpose of impeaching the
president. I call his attention to the fact, that
I made no allusion whatever to the question of
impeachment; I have nothing to say in that
direction until I hear from the committee. I
expressed it as my opinion merely that the
President of the United States would be very
glad to have the fortieth congress adjourn, and
this I understood from the friends of the president.”</p>

<p>Mr. Boutwell, taking part, said, “The great
and substantial reason is that whether this
House shall proceed to impeach the president or
not, the majority of the people of this country,
South and North, black and white, loyal and rebel,
have pretty generally lost confidence in him.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said Mr. Blaine.</p>

<p>“Whether this loss of confidence be based
upon facts of his character, or measures of his
public policy, or upon suspicion or prejudice
merely, I do not propose now to inquire. The
great fact is, the people of the country everywhere
have lost confidence in the wisdom, if
not in the honesty, of his administration.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine. “The gentleman will allow me to
inquire whether he thinks that our staying here
will restore confidence in the president.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>“No, Sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine held the floor under a certain rule
of congress, and gave his time to others as they
desired to discuss the question, but at the end
was firm as a rock. His mind was unchanged,
and from this and other instances the truth appears,
that as he used only facts, figures, testimony,
experience, written or related evidence of
a personal character, and that he could not be
gainsaid, and was never metaphysical, <i>a priori</i>,
or theorizing in his discussions, so nothing but
facts or figures, something tangible and real, influenced
him. The sailing of an eagle might be
very beautiful, and elicit feelings of admiration
and sublimity, but it did not influence his judgment.</p>

<p>Only the kind of arguments he used to influence
other minds would influence his,—and
when his mind was made up, it was from just
these sources of evidence that are so convincing,
so incontrovertible, giving strength to the mind,
and putting granite under the feet of the man.</p>

<p>As one has said, “I believed, therefore have
I spoken”; so with him, he believed, and therefore
spoke. No surface-current, only the deep
under-current, moved him.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine has great accuracy in the use of
language, and although off-hand and often under
peculiarly distracting circumstances, one who followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
him quite closely through his various utterances,
did not discover a grammatical mistake
until near the end of the fortieth congress, and
that was possibly a mistake of the printer, and
very slight in itself, using “to” for “at” in the
phrase “strike at the senate committee clerks
more than it does <i>to</i> ours.”</p>

<p>Congress adjourned on the 30th of March until
the 21st of November, unless a quorum was
present the 3d of July, and if so a session
would be held. A brief session of two weeks
was held, but Mr. Blaine was not there. He
and Elihu B. Washburne and another congressman
were in Europe. It was Mr. Blaine’s first
trip. Liverpool was visited, and commercial interests
were studied. Imagination seldom furnishes
right impressions. No one about whom
we have heard ever looks as we expected he was
going to. It always gets great men too large
on the outside, and enormous cities either too
large or too small, as the case may be. Liverpool
was immense; it has to be so. Almost limitless
is England’s foreign trade. What men they
must have been to make their island so important
as to compel the commerce of the world
to visit them! It was wonderful; the ships and
cargoes for all of India, for Egypt, for all of
Europe, for Australia, for America, and the Indies,
for Mexico, China and Japan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>It was indeed a study for him whose mind
must find the merits of every subject. It was
not simply a matter of landing safely and boarding
a train for London. The war was but two
years over. The Alabama was not forgotten, nor
all of England’s mischief. Ships and shipping in
all their construction and competition had been
the study of years to him, and to take in those
busy scenes upon the Mersey and the Clyde,
was but the reading of a new book to one familiar
with the language.</p>

<p>They reach the great metropolis. Parliament
is their objective point. Few will have more
brains than they bring with them, or know
more about their affairs of state; but the study
is to be long and careful, and they are to know
more fully the inner life and character of those
who have made laws for half the world. Day
after day, week after week, the great Head Centre
in all its ramifications is studied at shortest
possible range.</p>

<p>But Scotland and Ireland must be visited, for
they are the home of his ancestors. He breathes
the air, he sees the sky, he presses the sod, he
touches the heather. He is really, truly there.
The dream of boyhood days, when he stood by
grandfather’s knee, and heard of the old clans,
the blowing of the horn, and the echoes down
the valleys, of the cows and sheep, and the tinkling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
of the bells, the clash of arms and the battles
won; and now he is there, thrilled with the
memories and the ancient scenes. The old castles,
quaint, and moss-covered, and grand, and the
people with their fresh look and fiery eye, vigilant
ever to the end of time. What valleys and
mountains and peoples are there; what rivers and
lakes and loud-sounding sea! Surely nothing short
of an affair of the Stuarts would compel them
to quit their strongholds and their homes, their
native heather, and flee to other lands, so far,
so very far away as it was then, back in that
olden time.</p>

<p>What events have transpired since that 1720,
nearly one hundred and fifty years before. What
events in Europe, England and America. What
in India and the Orient; and yet the man of
eighty had sat, a boy of five, upon his grandsire’s
knee who had rounded out his four-score
years, and a boy of ten had walked with him
upon the highlands, and so could bring the messages
of that far-off time to present generations.</p>

<p>As Mr. Garfield had “during his only visit to
England busied himself in searching out every
trace of his forefathers in parish-registries and
ancient army-rolls,” so his inheritor of the nation’s
honors traced back the stock from which
he sprang to mountain, glen, and castle, which
had rung with the name he bore. He too might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
say, sitting with a friend in the gallery of the
House of Commons, “that when patriots of English
blood had struck sturdy blows for constitutional
government and human liberty, his family
had been represented.”</p>

<p>But they continue their journey, and cross the
English channel from Dover to Calais, and soon
are in the capital of the French Empire. Napoleon
III is there in his glory. Two years
later his traveling companion, Hon. E. B. Washburne,
is to be United States minister at his
court, and not long after a prisoner in Paris
during its siege in the Franco-Prussian war.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine’s knowledge of French serves him,
and enables him to secure all the general information
he desired. He was not among free institutions
now, and felt the keen chill in the
very atmosphere. But in visiting the French
Assembly there was a show of liberty, like an
eagle in a cage. It was a noisy, tumultuous
scene, with a jargon indescribable and largely
unintelligible. Few things are wilder, except the
ocean in a storm, than the deliberative assembly
of the French nation when measures of special
importance are pending. But the great city, with
its multitudes of people, is full of attractions.</p>

<p>The Tuilleries is visited, and the Champs
Elysées, the great armies so soon to reel in the
shock of war, and learn a lesson of sobriety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
and contented home-life that shall give to the
French of the future a greatness that has in it
more of the element of stability and permanency,
and so tone down their mercurial and volatile
nature. The Rhine is visited, and Florence.</p>

<p>Relaxation and rest are great objects of the
visit. The malaria of the Potomac at Washington,
which gets into the bones of congressmen,
and senators, and presidents, must be gotten out
of him, and he made ready for greater service
and larger conquests.</p>

<p>History is all about him; the nations of Europe
are within his reach; their capitals are
visited, and they are studied from life. Impressions
deep, and strong, and lasting are made.
Plutarch’s old method of comparisons and contrasts
still serves him, and he gets his knowledge
in classified, compact forms. The people
and their condition, their rulers and the laws,
interest him as much as the great, queer buildings,
the splendid palaces, the magnificent cathedrals,
the varied works of art, and the giant
mountains, the beautiful villages, valleys, and
lakes, and all that is picturesque in nature.
Switzerland is a charm; Italy a delight, and the
whole journey a joy. He returns a broader,
deeper, wiser man, to live a stronger, richer life
in a larger world.</p>

<p>He was in his seat at the beginning of congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
in November. Eight men are there from
Tennessee, whose right to seats is challenged.
The impeachment question has gained prominence,
and he joins in the search for evidence.
He does not want hearsay, but official documents,
and so he introduces a resolution, calling
upon the general commanding the armies to
communicate to the House any and all correspondence
addressed by him to the president
upon the removal of Secretary Stanton and
General Sheridan, and General Sickles as well;
and also with reference to the proposed mission
of the general of the army to Mexico in 1866.</p>

<p>But his great friend, Senator Fessenden, is
now secretary of the treasury, and this gives
the financial question a new interest, and he
comes to the front in a most vigorous manner
as vindicator and defender of the secretary’s
financial policy, in one of his great speeches on
the currency.</p>

<p>It is quite early in the session, only five
days after congress convened. His friend, Mr.
Washburne, had taken the initiatory step by
moving they go into committee of the whole on
the state of the Union.</p>

<p>Mr. Dawes was in the chair, and the question
related to the reduction of the currency. Erroneous
and mischievous views had been put forward,
regarding the nature of the public obligation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
imposed by the debt of the United States.
Various forms of repudiation had been suggested.
Mr. Pendleton, the recent Democratic candidate
for vice-president, and General Butler, of Massachusetts,
had assumed the position that “the
principal and the interest of United States bonds,
known as the five-twenties, may be fairly and
legally paid in paper currency by the government,
after the expiration of five years from the
date of the issue.”</p>

<p>And just here we get a view of Mr. Blaine’s
power of analysis; the ability of his mind to
grasp a subject in its great features and fundamental
principles; to bring to the surface its
underlying points or elements of strength and
weakness, so classified and arranged as to state
them in logical and convincing propositions, and
all of them most practical in their character.</p>

<p>1. “The position contravenes the honor and
good faith of the national government.” And
this was the final view adhered to by the best
statesmen of the Republican party.</p>

<p>2. “It is hostile to the spirit and letter of
the law.</p>

<p>3. “It contemptuously ignores the common
understanding between borrower and lender at
the time the loan was negotiated (which was by
Jay Cooke &amp; Co. in 1863, to the extent of five
hundred million dollars), a large proportion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
which was purchased by foreign capitalists, and
was very successful. Nothing was said about
payment in gold, but payment in gold, both of
principal and interest, had been the invariable
rule from the foundation of the government.”</p>

<p>“Our government,” said Nathaniel Mason, “is
a hard-money government, founded by hard-money
men, and its debts are hard-money debts.”</p>

<p>Nothing was intimated to the contrary when
the bill was passed and the bonds issued, and
the duties on imports pledged to their payment,
were to be paid in coin. The final point in his
argument was:—</p>

<p>4. “It would prove disastrous to the financial
interests of the government, and the general
prosperity of the country,” by, of course,
reducing the par value of the bonds and blockading
their sale as they floated through the
markets of the world.</p>

<p>It should be with some pride and glory now,
after the honorable history of the national debt
thus far, and which has given to the nation the
credit of the world, that Mr. Blaine remembers
that so early in the discussion, when the ideas
of the many were crude, and only those of the
few were clear, that he closed his speech with
these splendid words,—words which embody the
steady policy of the government from that time
to the present:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>“I am sure,” said Mr. Blaine, “that in the
peace which our arms have conquered, we shall
not dishonor ourselves by withholding from any
public creditor a dollar that we promised to pay
him; nor seek by cunning construction and
clever afterthought to evade or escape the full
responsibility of our national indebtedness. It
will doubtless cost us a vast sum to pay that
indebtedness, but it will cost us incalculably
more not to pay it.”</p>

<p>It took Gen. Benj. F. Butler two days to reply
to this speech of Mr. Blaine’s, in which he
bloomed forth as a greenbacker of fullest flower
and strongest fragrance. This led Mr. Blaine to
say:—</p>

<p>“We have a loan distinctly defined, well known
to the people, that has a specific rate of interest,
a certain time to run, and express condition
on which it is to be paid; but the gentleman
from Massachusetts is for brushing this all aside
and placing before the country a species of
legal-tender notes which have no fixed time to
run, bear no interest, have no standard of value,
and which the government is under no obligation
to pay at any particular time, and which
may indeed never be called in for redemption.”</p>

<p>And all of this reminded Mr. Blaine of a
story:—</p>

<p>“I think the gentleman must have borrowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
his notions of finance from a man who failed a
few years since in one of the eastern cities of
Maine, and who wrote over his store-door, ‘Payment
suspended for thirty days.’ A neighbor
passing by said to him, ‘You have neglected to
date your notice.’ ‘Why, no,’ said he, ‘I did not
intend to date it; it would run out if I did.’
And so the gentleman was to issue a government
legal tender that never runs out.”</p>

<p>The sitting of congress during the winter of
1867 and 1868, was long and tedious, extending
from November on into July. Mr. Blaine was
on the committee on appropriations, and had
charge of the army-appropriation bill on its passage
through the House. The army had been
reduced to sixty regiments, and thirty-two million
dollars asked to pay them, while before the
war twenty-five million dollars for the army, consisting
of only nineteen, or as Mr. Blaine put
it, “a regiment under the Democratic administration
preceding the war cost more than double
in gold what it costs now under General Grant
in paper, or in other words, that it cost on an
average over a million of dollars in gold to a
regiment then, and when General Grant was in
charge, about half a million to a regiment.”</p>

<p>It required great patience, courage, and intelligence
to stand by such a bill for two or three
days, answer all questions, meet all objections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
and opposition, and keep sweet all through; for
it was made a political question, as nearly every
measure was, and so the opposition party would
sit there and resist and vote in a bunch, but
usually to no purpose. The great impeachment
trial had come on, and was being conducted by
the senate in the presence of members of the
House.</p>

<p>This caused their adjournment after the morning
hour until three o’clock, daily. The managers
of the trial, chosen by the House, were
John A. Bingham, George S. Boutwell, James F.
Wilson, Benjamin F. Butler, Thomas Williams,
John A. Logan, and Thaddeus Stevens.</p>

<p>Having faithfully performed all his work upon
the great committee, and seen to it that every
trust confided to him in congress was sacredly
discharged, he procured an indefinite leave of absence,
after being there day and night for some
eight months, and not being one of the managers
of the impeachment trial, and having no active
part to take in its proceedings, and so he went
home to conduct the summer campaign, giving
himself, however, but two months for this purpose.
He had been absent in Europe, the summer
before, and now he had been re-nominated
to congress for the fourth time, something unusual
in the district, as he had been elected
three times already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>It would not do to fail, having been thus honored
by his party. So notwithstanding his long,
hard siege in congress, and which had brought him
more than ever into official communication with
heads of departments and the general of the
army, he devotes July and August to hard campaign-work,
discussing before the people the great
questions of the currency, and the war-debt,
etc., that had filled his mind in congress. His
experience there had been just the needed preparation
for this field-work, which was little more
than justifying their congressional actions and
explaining them.</p>

<p>The great question of the campaign was, “hard
or soft money,” as it was called. The seeds of
the greenback heresy, it will be recalled, had
been sown broadcast in Mr. Garfield’s Western
Reserve district in Ohio, and the convention met
to renominate him had declared for soft money,
when he was called in for a speech. He was a
hard-money man, and nothing else, and could not
stultify himself. He was begged by friends not
to antagonize the convention, but his firm reply
was, “I shall not violate my conscience and my
principles in this matter,” and so he made it
known to the convention without any compromise.
It was such an exhibition of courage, integrity,
and of all manly power, that they nominated him
at once by acclamation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>Mr. Blaine encountered the same heresy, and
wrung its neck most vigorously. He was up in
the art, as he had just had extensive experience
in congress. But 1868 was a presidential year.
U. S. Grant and Horatio Seymour were the candidates.</p>

<p>One president was being impeached, and another
being elected. Mr. Blaine had done what was
necessary for him in the case of one, and now was
doing what he could for the other. He had not
taken the most advanced grounds regarding the
impeachment. He was quite inclined to be conservative;
and while he did not oppose, neither
did he vehemently demand it at all hazards. It
was serious business, and he viewed it with the
broad, comprehensive mind of a statesman.</p>

<p>It was like “tearing up the foundation of
things,” as he said. He had a deep and delicate
sense of honor about it. The president was the
chief man of the nation, there by the suffrages
of a great people. Results seem to show that
all were finally brought to Mr. Blaine’s conclusions,
if not to his temper of mind upon the
subject. He simply did not make any violent
speeches in its favor, as so many did, but acted
effectively with his party for the right. His
strength was used in the campaign. He wanted
a new president of the right stamp, and knew
that if faithful work was done, they would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
one in less than a year. So to this task he
addressed himself with his accustomed energies,
and not without success, which had come to be
almost a matter of course, though hard, hot
fights were made against him.</p>

<p>General Grant received two hundred and fourteen
votes in the electoral college, to eighty-four
for Mr. Seymour, and again the Republican sky
was ablaze with great and wide-spread victory.</p>

<small>SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
IN CONGRESS.</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dct.jpg" width="75" height="76" alt="T">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE future had no clouds for Mr. Blaine
as he returned for the fourth time to
Washington as a member-elect to congress.
He was in manhood’s prime,
backed by a splendid record of triumph on the
field of political contest, and of achievement in
the arena of debate. He was thoroughly conversant
with the affairs of the House in every
detail of rule or measure, and was widely known
and recognized as among the most popular and
efficient members. His knowledge, gathered from
wide fields of travel, experience, and observation,
was vast; his powers thoroughly disciplined and
under the finest control; his acquaintance extensive,
and his rank high in personal and political
friendships.</p>

<p>Schuyler Colfax, the former speaker, was vice-president
now; standing next to General Grant,
the new president. Who should take his place?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
This was the question that filled Mr. Blaine
with high anticipations.</p>

<p>Granting his fitness and ability, which, perhaps,
no one who knows him at all would
question, the still greater question is how to win
the prize, how to secure the position. It is
purely a question of votes, and the one thing
that secures them is personal influence. It
may come of the individual’s own exertions,
his power to command, the charm of his name,
the fascination of his character, the magnetism
of his person. But it is a matter of stupendous
strength and of transcendent abilities
for one to lift himself so far above his fellows
as to win their suffrages in such a
place as that, by his own unaided personal attractions.</p>

<p>Here was the great argument, but not the
active agent. There must be some one to state
the case, to manage it, to make the appeal,
some one strong friend or more, who has grit
and gumption to put it through, and see it done,—that
man is Thaddeus Stevens, of his native
state of Pennsylvania. He is the one of all others
to do this thing.</p>

<p>Of few men’s power Mr. Blaine had a loftier
idea than of Mr. Thaddeus Stevens. There was
indeed a trio who attracted and held the admiration
of Mr. Blaine, and he has sketched their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
characters most vividly. Will you hear him as
he says:—</p>

<p>“The three most distinguished parliamentary
leaders hitherto developed in this country, are
Mr. Clay, Mr. Douglas, and Mr. Thaddeus Stevens.
They were all men of consummate ability,
of great earnestness, of intense personality, differing
widely each from the others, and yet with
a single trait in common,—the power to command.
In the give and take of daily discussion,
in the art of controlling and consolidating reluctant
and refractory followers, in the skill to
overcome all forms of opposition, and to meet
with competency and courage the varying phases
of unlooked-for assault, or unsuspected defection,
it would be difficult to rank with these a fourth
name in all our congressional history.</p>

<p>“But of these Mr. Clay was the greatest. It
would, perhaps, be impossible to find in parliamentary
annals, greater power than when, in
1841, at sixty-four years of age, he took the control
of the Whig party from the president who
had received their suffrages, against the power of
Webster in the cabinet, against the eloquence of
Choate in the senate, against the herculean efforts
of Caleb Cushing and Henry A. Wise in
the House. In unshared leadership, in the pride
and plenitude of power, he hurled against John
Tyler, with deepest scorn, the mass of that conquering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
column which had swept over the land
in 1840, and drove his administration to shelter
behind the lines of his political foes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Douglas achieved a victory scarcely less
wonderful, when, in 1854, against the secret desires
of a strong administration, against the wise
counsel of the older chiefs, against the conservative
instincts and even the moral sense of the
country, he forced a reluctant congress into a
repeal of the Missouri Compromise.</p>

<p>“And now we come to Mr. Thaddeus Stevens,
who, in his contests from 1865 to 1868, actually
advanced his parliamentary leadership until congress
tied the hands of the president, and governed
the country by its own will, leaving only
perfunctionary duties to be discharged by the executive.
With two hundred millions of patronage
in his hands at the opening of the contest,
aided by the active force of Seward in the cabinet,
and the moral power of Chase on the bench,
Andrew Johnson could not command the support
of one-third in either House against the parliamentary
uprising of which Thaddeus Stevens was
the animating spirit and the unquestioned leader.”</p>

<p>And this was the man who stood at Mr.
Blaine’s right hand in this matter of the speakership.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine was on the committee of military
affairs with Mr. Stevens. He became known to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
him thoroughly as a man with talent for indefatigable
toil, and a genius for doing hard and
difficult things with great certainty and despatch.
He was just the man to attract the attention,
and be admired, respected, and loved by a man
of Mr. Stevens’ consummate ability, and to be
selected by him for promotion and honor. And
the hour had come for just that honor, the highest
in the gift of the House.</p>

<p>It was the third office in the nation, with a
salary three thousand dollars greater than that
of United States senator, and equal to the salary
of vice-president or secretary of state. And so
by virtue of his recognized fitness, and the power
of this great friend, the office comes to him, and
he comes to it.</p>

<p>Some think, and perhaps rightly, that his tilt
with Mr. Conkling popularized him greatly with
the members of the House, who thoroughly enjoyed
it, and so prepared the way to the honor
which in point of fact was his by right of nature.
But six years was a long time to wait,
yet he waited, and was rewarded. And still it
was not waiting, but working, with him, occupying
the stronghold he had made for himself in
the manifold business of the House.</p>

<p>But now he is taken from this, and out of
the arena of debate, and yet lifted into greater
prominence and power; appointing all the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
committees of the House, a task requiring the
highest order of ability in the knowledge of men;
deciding all questions, and exercising a controlling
influence over legislation.</p>

<p>There is little power men employ in all the
great work of life, but he needs it in its rarest
form. He must be a broad, a wide, a universal
man; in sympathy with all, so far as right and
justice are concerned. There are the choice, the
crowned ones from every congressional district
in all the states and territories, and he is the
choice, the crowned one among them,—their
chosen chief.</p>

<p>Tennyson’s words press for utterance right
here, as we see him step from the floor to the
speaker’s chair:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“Divinely gifted man,</div>
<div class="indent">Whose life in low estate began,</div>
<div class="verse">And on a simple village green.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“Who breaks his birth’s invidious bar,</div>
<div class="indent">And grasps the skirts of happy chance,</div>
<div class="indent">And breasts the blow of circumstance,</div>
<div class="verse">And grapples with his evil star.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“Who makes by force his merit known,</div>

</div>

<div class="indent">The pillar of a people’s hope,</div>
<div class="verse">The centre of a world’s desire.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>It was only by the proof of character, the
most solid and reliable, he could possibly have
secured the friendship of Mr. Stevens. And not
his alone, but the friendship of Hon. Elihu B.
Washburne, of Illinois, who nominated Mr. Blaine
as candidate for speaker, and who, as senior
member, swore him in.</p>

<p>It was a proud day for Mr. Washburne, the
staunch friend of General Grant, to witness his
inaugural, and then, as the true friend of Mr.
Blaine, aid so largely in putting him into the
speaker’s chair the same day.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevens was not there to enjoy the triumph
of his friend, but his endorsement was
good as a letter of credit.</p>

<p>When the ballot was concluded it read:—Whole
number of votes cast, one hundred and
ninety-two; necessary for a choice, ninety-seven;
Mr. Blaine received one hundred and thirty-five;
Mr. Kerr received fifty-seven.</p>

<p>Mr. Dawes and Mr. Kerr conducted him to
the chair, when he addressed the House as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen of the House of Representatives</span>:</p>

<p>“I thank you profoundly for the great honor which
your votes have just conferred upon me. The gratification
which this signal mark of your confidence
brings to me, finds its only drawback in the diffidence
with which I assume the weighty duties devolving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
upon me. Succeeding to a chair made illustrious
by such eminent statesmen, and skilled parliamentarians
as Clay, and Stevenson, and Polk, and Winthrop,
and Banks, and Grow, and Colfax, I may
well distrust my ability to meet the just expectations
of those who have shown me such marked partiality.
But relying, gentlemen, upon my honest purpose to
perform all my duties faithfully and fearlessly, and
trusting in a large measure to the indulgence which
I am sure you will always extend to me, I shall
hope to retain, as I have secured, your confidence,
your kindly regard, and your generous support.</p>

<p>“The forty-first congress assembles at an auspicious
period in the history of our government. The splendid
and impressive ceremonial which we have just
witnessed in another part of the capitol [Grant’s inauguration],
appropriately symbolizes the triumphs of
the past, and the hopes of the future, a great chieftain,
whose sword at the head of gallant and victorious
armies, saved the Republic from dismemberment
and ruin, has been fitly called to the highest civic
honor which a grateful people can bestow. Sustained
by a congress which so ably represents the loyalty,
the patriotism, and the personal worth of the nation,
the president this day inaugurated will assure to the
country an administration of purity, fidelity, and
prosperity; an era of liberty regulated by law, and
of law thoroughly inspired with liberty.</p>

<p>“Congratulating you, gentlemen, on the happy auguries
of the day, and invoking the gracious blessings
of Almighty God on the arduous and responsible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
labors before you, I am now ready to take the
oath of office, and enter upon the discharge of the
duties to which you have called me.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is a curious coincidence that General
Schenck, of Ohio, who startled Mr. Blaine with
the charge of irrelevancy at his first utterance
on the floor, but was so utterly discomfited
afterwards, is now the first one to address him
as “Mr. Speaker,” and Mr. Kerr, his competitor,
soon follows.</p>

<p>It was at this session that new members from
reconstructed states appeared, and many were
the objections made to this new member
and that, because of disloyalty. It was to present
a charge of this kind that Mr. Schenck
arose.</p>

<p>The noticeable feature of Mr. Blaine’s speakership
is the expeditious manner in which business
is conducted, and the consequent brevity
of sessions.</p>

<p>It may be observed right here that Mr.
Blaine’s friend, E. B. Washburne, chose rather
to go as minister to Paris, and Hamilton Fish
became secretary of state.</p>

<p>For two successive congresses Mr. Blaine was
re-elected speaker by the large Republican majorities
serving through the reconstruction period
of the rebel states, and through most of General
Grant’s two terms of the presidency. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
was during this period his reputation became
truly national.</p>

<p>He might have occupied the chair all the
time, and taken things easy; but this was not
his nature. It was his privilege to go upon the
floor, and take up the gauntlet of debate. It
was expected that things would become lively
at once when he did so. There was a resolution
one day for a committee to investigate the
outrages in the South. Mr. Blaine had written
the resolution, which was presented by his colleague,
and asked for its passage; and, lest the
<i>claquers</i> should say he put only “weak-kneed
Republicans” on the committee, he made Benj.
F. Butler chairman, which in some almost unaccountable
way greatly enraged Mr. Butler, who
might have then contemplated accompanying Gen.
John M. Palmer and others into the Democratic
party, and so he telegraphed to newspapers and
issued a circular which appeared on the desks
of members, denouncing what he was pleased to
call a trick, and used other vigorous language
on the floor of the House. Of course the
speaker could not sit quietly in the chair and
be thus tempestuously assailed, so calling a
future vice-president to the chair (Wheeler), he
said, “I wish to ask the gentleman from Massachusetts
whether he denies me the right to
have drawn that resolution” (it was presented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
in the caucus first which had just re-nominated
Mr. Blaine for speaker).</p>

<p>Mr. Butler replied, “I have made no assertion
on that subject, one way or other.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine: “Did not the gentleman know
distinctly that I drew it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir!” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Did I not take it to the gentleman and
read it to him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Mr. Butler.</p>

<p>“Did I not show him the manuscript?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“And at his suggestion,” continued Mr. Blaine,
“I added these words, ‘and the expenses of
said committee shall be paid from the contingent
fund of the House of Representatives’ (applause),
and the fact that ways and means were wanted
to pay the expenses was the only objection he
made to it.”</p>

<p>It appears that the resolution was considered
as a test of the Republicanism of members.
General Butler had been asked to take the
chairmanship, but refused, and said he would
have nothing to do with the resolution; but Mr.
Blaine put him on the committee, and when
asked why, replied, “Because I knew very well
that if I omitted the appointment of the
gentleman it would be heralded throughout the
length and breadth of the country by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
<i>claquers</i>, who have so industriously distributed
this letter this morning, that the speaker had
packed the committee, as the gentleman said he
would, with ‘weak-kneed Republicans,’ who
would not go into an investigation vigorously,
as he would. That was the reason (applause),
so that the chair laid the responsibility upon
the gentleman of declining the appointment, and
now the gentleman from Massachusetts is on his
responsibility before the country,” and there we
leave him.</p>

<p>It can but be with peculiar interest that we
read the strong words of the oath taken so
repeatedly by Mr. Blaine, and administered the
second time by Mr. Dawes, of Massachusetts,
after he had received one hundred and twenty-six
votes, to ninety-two for Gen. George W. Morgan,
of Ohio.</p>

<p>It kept a large committee busy to pass upon
the character of members-elect and the legality
of their election. Such was the broken condition
of state governments in the South, so battered
by war, and distracted by schism and contending
factions. All of these perplexities adhered to
applicants for membership in congress, presenting
credentials of membership various in value as
greenbacks and gold, and these same perplexities
affected the staple of congressional measures.</p>

<p>Congress was increasing rapidly in the number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
of its members, so that while one hundred and
ninety-two votes were cast at Mr. Blaine’s first
election to the speakership in 1869, there were
two hundred and sixty-nine votes cast at his
election to the same office in 1873, of which
number he received one hundred and eighty-nine,
and Mr. Ferdinand Wood received seventy-six.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine refers to it in his address to the
“Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,”
the last time he was elected speaker. “To be
chosen,” he says, “speaker of the House of
Representatives is always an honorable distinction;
to be chosen a third time enhances the honor
more than three fold; to be chosen <i>by the
largest body that ever assembled in the Capitol</i>
imposes a burden of responsibility which only
your indulgent kindness could embolden me to
assume. The first occupant of this chair presided
over a House of sixty-five members, representing
a population far below the present aggregate of
the state of New York. At that time there
were not, in the whole United States, fifty
thousand civilized inhabitants to be found one
hundred miles distant from the flow of the Atlantic
tide. To-day, gentlemen, a large majority
of you come from beyond that limit, and represent
districts peopled then only by the Indian
and the adventurous frontiersman.</p>

<p>“The national government is not yet as old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
as many of its citizens, but in this brief span
of time,—less than one lengthened life,—it has,
under God’s good providence, extended its power
until a continent is the field of its empire, and
attests the majesty of its law.</p>

<p>“With the growth of new states and the
resulting changes in the centres of population,
new interests are developed, rival to the old, but
by no means hostile; diverse, but not antagonistic.
Nay, rather are all these interests in harmony,
and <i>the true science of just government is
to give to each its full and fair play, oppressing
none by undue exaction, favoring none by undue
privilege</i>.</p>

<p>“It is this great lesson which our daily experience
is teaching, binding us together more
closely, making our mutual dependence more
manifest, and causing us to feel that, whether
we live in the North or in the South, in
the East or in the West, we have indeed but
‘one country, one constitution, one destiny.’”</p>

<p>Few addresses so brief breathe a spirit of
broader statesmanship, or loftier ideal of civil
government. Two years before this, in 1871, he
had been charged by General Butler with having
presidential aspirations, and surely he was
able to manifest the true conception of a just
and righteous government, “oppressing none by
undue exaction, favoring none by undue privilege,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
which is apparently the exact outcome—a
sort of paraphrase of Lincoln’s words, “With
malice toward none, with charity toward all.”</p>

<p>Many who had participated in the Rebellion,
having had their political disabilities removed
by the vote of two-thirds of each House of congress,
came forward and took the special oath
provided for them by act of July 11, 1868.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine seldom, if ever, leaves the chair
to participate in debate when questions of a
political nature are pending, so that he may
hold himself aloof for fair ruling in all of his
decisions.</p>

<p>The position of speaker is, in many respects,
a thankless one. When party spirit runs high,
as it does at times, like the tide of battle, in
the great debates, men are swept on by their
sympathies, as barks are tossed in ocean-storms,
and under the influence of their most powerful
prejudices they are driven to rash and unwarrantable
conclusions regarding the justice of any
ruling, to conjectures the most unfair and wanton
regarding motive, and as in the case of
Mr. Blaine, to the most stupendous efforts at
political assassination.</p>

<p>But it was not until the days of his speakership
were over, and the people at home had
expressed their confidence in him and their love
and admiration for him, by electing him to congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
for the seventh time consecutively, that
the storm struck him. It had been gathering
long. Its animus was enmity, its bulk was hate,
its dark, frowning exterior was streaked with the
lurid lightnings of a baleful jealousy; muttering
thunders like the deep growlings of exasperation
were heard oft, but feared not.</p>

<p>The solid South had marched its rebel brigadiers
by the score into the arena of national
questioning and discussion, where for twelve
years he had stood intrepid as the founders of
the Republic. No man was more at home upon
that field than he,—none more familiar with
the men, the methods, and the measures that
had triumphed there,—and few have been more
victorious in the great ends for which he strove,
few readier to challenge the coming of any
man, to know his rights, his mission, and his
weight. He was, of all men, the most unconquerable
by those who plead for measures subversive
of any great or minor end for which the war
was fought.</p>

<p>He had gained the credit of the fourteenth
amendment, and had been identified with all.
He was simply bent upon resistance, the most
powerful he could command, against all encroachments
of the bad and false, and to show no favor
toward any feature for which rebellion fought.
Fair, honorable, just,—none could be more so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>When speaker of the House, he was informed
one day that a prominent correspondent of a
leading paper, who had maligned and vilified
him shockingly, was on the floor, and at once
he said, “Invite him up here,” and he gave
him a seat by his side, within the speaker’s
desk, and placed at the disposal of the man the
information of public importance at his command.
The fellow was amazed, and went away and
wrote how kindly he had been treated by the
great-hearted man of noble impulses, after he
had so roundly abused him.</p>

<p>There is nothing vindictive about him, nothing
despicable. He is severe, herculean, desperate
for the right, and will win in every battle
that commands the forces of his being, if victory
be achievable. But he honors strong, square
men, who have convictions and dare proclaim
them; but petty, mean, ignoble souls are first
despised, then pitied.</p>

<p>But the day of his betrayal came, the day of
rebel wrath; and he met the stroke before the
nation’s gaze, and was vindicated before the
world.</p>

<p>A business correspondence, it had been said he
had burned. He said, “No, there it is, and I
will read it to the House,” and he read it.
What business firm, it has been asked, would
like to have their correspondence regarding any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
great business interest, read to those who are
filled with all manner of suspicions, and so have
it misjudged, misinterpreted, and misapplied?
And then, to show the temper of those with
whom he dealt, a cablegram from Europe vindicating
him, was for two days suppressed by the
chairman of the congressional committee, before
whom he stood, and who failed to convict him
by any document at their command. The scene
at that time, and their discomfiture, is thus described
by an eye-witness:—</p>

<p>“His management of his own case when the
Mulligan letters came out was worthy of any
general who ever set a squadron in the field.
For nearly fifteen years I have looked down
from the galleries of the House and Senate, and
I never saw, and never expect to see, and
never have read of such a scene, where the
grandeur of human effort was better illustrated,
than when this great orator rushed down the
aisle, and, in the very face of Proctor Knott,
charged him with suppressing a telegram favorable
to Blaine. The whole floor and all the
galleries were wild with excitement. Men yelled
and cheered, women waved their handkerchiefs
and went off into hysterics, and the floor was
little less than a mob.”</p>

<p>About this time, Hon. Lot M. Morrill, of his
state, was transferred from the senate to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
cabinet of President Grant, and as a partial
justification, General Connor, the governor of
Maine at this time, appointed him to represent
Maine in the United States senate in place of
Mr. Morrill. The official note was as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Augusta</span>, Maine, July 9, 1876.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">To Hon. Milton Saylor</span>, <i>Speaker of the House of<br>
&#160; &#160; Representatives, Washington, D. C.</i>:</p>

<p>“Having tendered to the Hon. James G. Blaine
the appointment of senator in congress, he has placed
in my hands his resignation as representative from
the third district of Maine, to take effect Monday,
July 10, 1876.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright2">“SELDON CONNOR,</span><br>
“<i>Governor of Maine</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>When the legislature of his state met, he came
before them and placed himself under a thorough
investigation at their hands. And as Ex-Gov. A.
P. Morrill says, “They made thorough work of
it.” A man to come forth from such an ordeal
unscathed, and without the smell of fire on his
garments, must be right and not wrong,—or else
he is the veriest scoundrel, guilty, deeply so, and
competent for bribes, and they, the legislature of
Maine, who virtually tried him, hopelessly corrupt.
But, no! this cannot be; and so he was vindicated,
and triumphantly elected by them to the
highest trust within their gift, to wear the honors
of a Morrill and a Fessenden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span></p>

<p>And yet again do they elect him for a full
term of years. And then the royal Garfield, the
nation’s loved and honored president, knowing
all, and knowing him most intimately for seventeen
years or more, takes him into his cabinet,
trustingly, and for the nation’s good.</p>

<p>Can victory be grander, or triumph more complete,
endorsement more honorable, or vindication
more just, or a verdict be more patient, thorough,
or exhaustive of evidence! What man in
all the land, traduced and vilified just as Washington,
Lincoln, and Garfield were, wears prouder
badges of endorsement from congress, governor,
legislature, senate, and conventions by the score!
What man that bears credentials of his character
as trophies of higher worth, from judges of
sounder mind, and lives more unimpeachable?
Answer, ye who can!</p>

<small>UNITED STATES SENATOR.</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dci.jpg" width="77" height="75" alt="I">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>T was generally understood in Maine
that the Hon. Lot M. Morrill was
serving his last term in the United
States senate, and that Mr. Blaine
was to be his successor; so that when Mr. Morrill
was advanced to the secretaryship of the
treasury in General Grant’s cabinet, it occasioned
no surprise that Governor Connor appointed Mr.
Blaine to the senate in his stead. He was
just recovering from the partial sunstroke which
felled him to the pavement while on his way
to church, on a Sabbath morning, with Miss
Abigail Dodge (Gail Hamilton), just prior to the
Cincinnati Convention, and soon after his victory
over Proctor Knott, during his persecution in
the House. Next to the nomination at Cincinnati,
nothing of a political nature could have
been more grateful to him than this high honor
from the governor of his state, in accordance,
as the governor himself says, with the expectation
of the people. Coming, as it did, at an ill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
and weary time, it must have greatly refreshed
and revived his spirits, to have new and larger
evidence of the esteem and endorsement of those
to whose interests his life was devoted.</p>

<p>On July 12, 1876, he took his seat as the
colleague of Hannibal Hamlin in the senate. He
is placed at once as chairman on the committee
on rules, and on the committee on appropriations,
and on naval affairs, besides on a select
committee “on the levees on the Mississippi
River.” This, for a senatorial start, was quite
honorable to his judgment and ability.</p>

<p>There are many old traditions and customs,
which amount to laws, so far as assigning positions
of responsibility to new members is concerned,
but there is no law which prevents a
new member from taking the most advanced
position possible by virtue of his wisdom and
knowledge, and his ability in debate.</p>

<p>He could not well become entangled in the
meshes of an intricate network of rules and
regulations, which Butler, in acknowledging Mr.
Blaine’s superior knowledge of in the House,
had said he knew nothing about,—Blaine knew
it all. His position made it necessary that he
should, and now he was made chief in this department
in the new branch of legislation to
which he had succeeded. So he could not be
held or hampered by any difficulty of this kind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
Moreover, his acquaintance was well-nigh universal
among the members, and some of them
knew him a little better than they could have
wished. He was also familiar with the methods
and measures of the senate, having frequently
been on joint committees with them during his
early terms of service in the lower House, and
then the general subjects of appropriations, naval,
military, judiciary, manufactures, commerce,
foreign affairs, finance, pension affairs, etc., these
were the subjects with which he was accustomed
to deal during all of his years in congress.</p>

<p>He was at home, and coming into the senate
on the wave of popular excitement, which was
of the same broad and sweeping character that
surrounded Henry Clay, and which came so
near giving him the nomination for the presidency
then, he was not only at home in all
his feelings of political association and public
duty, but exceedingly prominent as well,—the
one man of worth above all others, though the
last to enter there.</p>

<p>He had no need to take front rank; he was
there already, and gave himself to his work,
not as a defeated man,—they had played but
one inning then,—but as a victor, enjoying his
promotion well, from the lower to the upper
house of congress. He was nearing the goal,
taking the honors by the way, just as Garfield<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
did, but unlike him, tarrying in the senate to
enjoy them. It was a good place to be; grand
enough to command the lives, in all their richness
and maturity, of Sumner, Webster, Choate,
of Hamlin, Fessenden, and Clay, of Wilson,
Edmunds, Dawes, and galaxies by the score,
representing every state in the Union. Great
lights from every department of life shone there:
scholars, teachers, authors, successful generals;
culture, refinement, and every excellence.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine brought with him from the House,
his old spirit of freeness, and general adaptability
and service. He had not come in to rest, be
shelved, or fossilized. His old habit of thoroughness
was on him still; he was not the man
to change at six and forty years of age. He
must still touch top, bottom, and sides of every
question with which he dealt, and so he did.</p>

<p>He loved the truths of history, and took
them whole, entire, lacking nothing, and not in a
garbled form. This of course caused facts and
figures to strike with telling power upon many
a man’s coat of mail, or cause the shield to
tremble with the power of his stroke. But he
was there without apology, to do the strong,
decisive work which marked the history of his
life. He loved the state of his adoption, and
the time had come when the pride of her glory
should appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>The old House of Representatives had been
devoted, as a gallery of art, to portraits and
statues of the great men of the nation. Two
were to be selected by each state from the
record of their leading men.</p>

<p>The statue of William King, the first governor
of Maine, in 1820 and 1821, was presented with
speeches in the senate by both Mr. Hamlin and
Mr. Blaine. In reciting briefly the history of
Mr. King, Mr. Blaine relied wholly upon Massachusetts
authority, and he added, “To have given
anything like a sketch of Governor King’s life
without giving his conflict with Massachusetts,
touching the separation of Maine and her erection
into an independent state, would have been
like writing the life of Abraham Lincoln without
mentioning the great Rebellion, which, as
president of the United States, he was so largely
instrumental in suppressing.”</p>

<p>These words he uttered in vindication of himself
from certain restrictions placed upon him,
and he closed by saying “that he notified the
senators from Massachusetts that he should feel
compelled to narrate those portions of Mr.
King’s history that brought him in conflict with
the parent state.”</p>

<p>In less than a month after the statue of
Governor King was placed in the national gallery,
by a unanimous vote of the senate, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
Blaine was before that body with a speech of
his usual force and energy, upon the absorbing
question of hard money. The subject had been
discussed in the House, and their action sent
to the senate, and Mr. Blaine had offered a
substitute for their bill, which contained three
very simple provisions, as he said, viz.:—</p>

<p>1. “That the dollar shall contain four hundred
and twenty-five grains of standard silver,
shall have unlimited coinage, and be an unlimited
legal tender.</p>

<p>2. “That all the profits of coinage shall go
to the government, and not to the operator in
silver bullion.</p>

<p>3. “That silver dollars or silver bullion,
assayed and mint-stamped, may be deposited
with the assistant treasurer at New York, for
which coin-certificates may be issued, the same
in denomination as United States notes, not
below ten dollars, and that these shall be redeemable
on demand in coin or bullion, thus
furnishing a paper-circulation based on an actual
deposit of precious metal, giving us notes as
valuable as those of the Bank of England and
doing away at once with the dreaded inconvenience
of silver on account of bulk and weight.”</p>

<p>He cites an exclusively gold nation like England,
which, while it may have some massive
fortunes, shows also the most hopeless and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
helpless poverty in the humblest walks of life.
But France, a gold-and-silver nation, while it can
exhibit no such fortunes as England boasts,
presents “a people who, with silver savings, can
pay a war indemnity that would have beggared
the gold-bankers of London, and to which the
peasantry of England could not have contributed
a pound sterling in gold, nor a single shilling
in silver.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine’s sense of justice, and national
honor, and national pride were injured by making
a dollar which, in effect, was not a dollar,—was
not worth a hundred cents.</p>

<p>“Consider, further,” he says, “what injustice
would be done to every holder of a legal-tender
or national-bank note. That vast volume of paper-money—over
seven hundred millions of dollars—is
now worth between ninety-eight and
ninety-nine cents on the dollar in gold coin.
The holders of it, who are indeed our entire
population, from the poorest to the wealthiest,
have been promised, from the hour of its issue,
that the paper-money would one day be as
good as gold. To pay silver for the greenback
is a full compliance with this promise and this
obligation, provided the silver is made as it
always has been hitherto, as good as gold. To
make our silver coin even three per cent. less
valuable than gold, inflicts at once a loss of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
more than twenty millions of dollars on the
holders of our paper-money. To make a silver
dollar worth but ninety-two cents, precipitates
on the same class a loss of well-nigh sixty millions
of dollars. For whatever the value of the
silver dollar is, the whole paper issue of the
country will sink to its standard when its coinage
is authorized and its circulation becomes
general in the channels of trade.</p>

<p>“Some one in conversation with Commodore
Vanderbilt during one of the many freight competitions
of the trunk lines, said, ‘Why, the
Canadian road has not sufficient carrying capacity
to compete with your great line!’</p>

<p>“‘That is true,’ replied the Commodore, ‘but
they can fix a rate and force us down to it.’</p>

<p>“Were congress to pass a law to-day, declaring
that every legal-tender note and every national-bank
note shall hereafter pass for only
ninety-six or ninety-seven cents on the dollar,
there is not a constituency in the United States
that would re-elect a man that should support
it, and in many districts the representative
would be lucky if he escaped with merely a
minority vote.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine’s sympathies in this discussion were
with the people, and although he had passed
out of that popular branch of congress, as it is
called, most nearly connected with them, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
could not in any sense be divorced from them,
and so, although before men of great wealth,
his plea was for the laboring class,—for those
who made the country strong and rich,—and so
in continuing his speech he pleaded for them; and
it will bring them nearer to him to-day to
recall his strong and earnest words, which, even
in the staid and formal senate, with its infinite
courtesies and conservative venerations, has a
heart to smile, and good cheer sufficient to
applaud, as they did this close of his hard-money
speech. These were his final utterances:—</p>

<p>“The effect of paying the labor of this country
in silver coin of full value, as compared
with irredeemable paper,—or as compared, even,
with silver of inferior value,—will make itself
felt in a single generation to the extent of tens
of millions—perhaps hundreds of millions—in
the aggregate savings which represent consolidated
capital. It is the instinct of man from
the savage to the scholar—developed in childhood,
and remaining with age—to value the
metals which in all tongues are called precious.</p>

<p>“Excessive paper-money leads to extravagance,
to waste, and to want, as we painfully witness
on all sides to-day. And in the midst of the
proof of its demoralizing and destructive effect,
we hear it proclaimed in the halls of congress,
that ‘the people demand cheap money.’ I deny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
it. I declare such a phrase to be a total misapprehension—a
total misinterpretation of the
popular wish. The people do not demand cheap
money. They demand an abundance of good
money, which is an entirely different thing.
They do not want a single gold standard that
will exclude silver, and benefit those already
rich. They do not want an inferior silver standard
that will drive out gold, and not help those
already poor. They want both metals, in full
value, in equal honor, in whatever abundance
the bountiful earth will yield them to the
searching eye of science, and to the hard hand
of labor.</p>

<p>“The two metals have existed side by side
in harmonious, honorable companionship, as money,
ever since intelligent trade was known among
men. It is well-nigh forty centuries since ‘Abraham
weighed to Ephron the silver which he
had named in the audience of the sons of Heth—four
hundred shekels of silver—current money
with the merchant.’ Since that time nations
have risen and fallen, races have disappeared,
dialects and languages have been forgotten, arts
have been lost, treasures have perished, continents
have been discovered, islands have been
sunk in the sea, and through all these ages,
and through all these changes, silver and gold
have reigned supreme as the representatives of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
value—as the media of exchange. The dethronement
of each has been attempted in turn, and
sometimes the dethronement of both; but always
in vain! And we are here to-day, deliberating
anew over the problem which comes down to
us from Abraham’s time—<i>the weight of the silver</i>
that shall be ‘current money with the merchant.’”</p>

<p>As Mr. Blaine resumed his seat, it is said,
in brackets, there was protracted applause; and
so much was there that the vice-president, William
A. Wheeler, of New York, felt compelled
to say, “Order! The chair assuming that the
galleries are ignorant of the laws of the senate,
gives notice that if applause is repeated they
will be promptly cleared.”</p>

<p>This cannot fail to suggest the fact beyond a
doubt, that he had lost none of his old-time
fervor, and that he proposed to allow no right
of the people to slip from them, so long as
he held place and power in their interest, and
had a voice to lift in their defence.</p>

<p>The great business of congress is done by
committees, as is well known, and their reports
are discussed, amended, and acted upon, endorsed
or rejected.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine’s committee on appropriations was
one of the most difficult. Demands are almost
innumerable, and to act intelligently requires a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
large knowledge of every department of the
government; of the military, the great postal
lines and offices, and the new ones being built,
custom-houses, forts, arsenals, navy-yards, etc.;
and this work must be done by the committees,
working not early, but late.</p>

<p>He was specially fitted for the committee on
naval affairs, as he had gone over the whole
question of ship-building and shipping while in
the House.</p>

<p>We find him actuated by the same feelings
of humanity and carefulness, as actuated him
years before, but now more conspicuously, because
in a larger, loftier sphere.</p>

<p>He presents bills for the relief of the families
of those who perished on the United States
dredge-boat “McAlister”; to enlarge the power
and duties of the board of health in the District
of Columbia; to amend the Pacific Railroad
act by creating a sinking-fund. He moved
to investigate charges against Senator M. C.
Butler, of South Carolina.</p>

<p>We find Mr. Blaine showing an appreciation
for that old soldier of the Republic, in the
Mexican war and the war of the Rebellion,
Hon. James Shields, of Missouri, by presenting
a bill to make him a major-general. General
Shields had a bullet through his body in Mexico,
at Buena Vista, and a silk handkerchief drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
through his body in the track of the wound,
and now he is honored as an old man; but he
does not live long to enjoy it. He was a hardy,
heroic, faithful man and soldier, and worthy
of the repeated honors conferred upon him by
his state and by the nation. It was a generous
impulse of a kindly heart that prompted this
honor in the senate for the aged soldier.</p>

<p>The bureau of engraving and printing was
remembered by him in a bill to provide that
department with a fire-proof building.</p>

<p>When the bill was before the senate to pension
the soldiers of the Mexican war, Mr. Hoar
offered a resolution by way of amendment:
“Provided, further, that no pension shall ever
be paid under this act to Jefferson Davis, the
late president of the so-called Confederacy.”
Twenty-two were found to vote against it. The
discussion grew now almost intolerable. Nearly
every rebel sympathizer from the South spoke
against it; among them were Garland, Bailey,
Maxey, Thurman, Gordon, Lamar, Morgan, Coke.
Strong hearts were stirred against their utterances,
and strong words uttered for the Union
cause.</p>

<p>“There is no parallel to the magnanimity of
our government,” said Mr. Blaine, in reply to
Lamar’s charge of intolerance. “Not one single
execution, not one single confiscation; at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
outside only fourteen thousand out of millions
put under disfranchisement, and all of them released,
and all of them invited to come to the
common board, fraternally and patriotically, with
the rest of us, and share a common destiny
for weal or for woe in the future. I tell the
honorable gentleman it does not become him,
or any Southern man, to speak of intolerance
on the part of the national government; rather,
if he speak of it at all, he should allude to its
magnanimity and its grandeur.”</p>

<p>The great boldness with which Mr. Blaine
stood up against the usurpations of the solid
South is a lasting honor to him. He desired
to place on record, in a definite and authentic
form, the frauds and outrages by which some
recent elections were carried by the Democratic
party in the Southern states, and to find if
there be any method to prevent a repetition of
those crimes against a free ballot. One hundred
and six representatives had been elected
recently in the South, and only four or five of
them Republicans, and thirty-five of the whole
number had been assigned to the South, he
said, “by reason of the colored people.” In
South Carolina, he speaks of “a series of skirmishes
over the state, in which the polling
places were regarded as forts, to be captured
by one party and held against the other, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
that there was no election in any proper sense.”
The information came from a non-partisan press,
and without contradiction so far as he had
seen.</p>

<p>This was his resolution in the senate:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the committee on the judiciary be
instructed to inquire and report to the senate, whether
at the recent elections the constitutional rights of
American citizens were violated in any of the states
of the Union; whether the right of suffrage of citizens
of the United States, or of any class of such
citizens, was denied or abridged by the action of the
election-officers of any state in refusing to receive
their votes, in failing to count them, or in receiving
and counting fraudulent ballots in pursuance of a conspiracy
to make the lawful votes of such citizens of
non effect; and whether such citizens were prevented
from exercising the elective franchise, or forced to use
it against their wishes, by violence or threats, or
hostile demonstrations of armed men or other organizations,
or by any other unlawful means or practices.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the committee on the judiciary be
further instructed to inquire and report whether it is
within the competency of congress to provide by additional
legislation for the more perfect security of
the right of suffrage to citizens of the United States
in all the states of the Union.</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That in prosecuting these inquiries the
judiciary committee shall have the right to send for
persons and papers.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>The negro had become practically disfranchised;
the true end of the war in his rightful liberty
as a freeman, in the full sense of the term,
was concerned; and the acts of government in
making him a citizen, and his representation in
congress according to the new allotment of
thirty-five representatives for the colored population;—all
these ends had been subverted, these
rights abrogated, and the constitution, in its
most sacred and dearly-bought amendments, violently
ignored, and men were there with perjury
on their lips and treason in their hearts, who
had countenanced and upheld all of this.</p>

<p>“Let me illustrate,” Mr. Blaine says, “by comparing
groups of states of the same representative
strength North and South. Take the states of
South Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana. They
send seventeen representatives to congress. Their
aggregate population is composed of ten hundred
and thirty-five thousand whites and twelve hundred
and twenty-four thousand colored; the colored
being nearly two hundred thousand in
excess of the whites. Of the seventeen representatives,
then, it is evident that nine were
apportioned to these states by reason of their
colored population, and only eight by reason of
their white population; and yet in the choice of
the entire seventeen representatives, the colored
voters had no more voice or power than their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
remote kindred on the shores of Senegambia or
on the Gold Coast. The ten hundred and thirty-five
thousand white people had the sole and absolute
choice of the entire seventeen representatives.</p>

<p>“In contrast, take two states in the North,
Iowa and Wisconsin, with seventeen representatives.
They have a white population of two
million two hundred and forty-seven thousand,—considerably
more than double the entire white
population of the three Southern states I have
named. In Iowa and Wisconsin, therefore, it
takes one hundred and thirty-two thousand white
population to send a representative to congress,
but in South Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana
every sixty thousand white people send a representative.
In other words, sixty thousand white
people in those Southern states have precisely
the same political power in the government of
the country that one hundred and thirty-two
thousand white people have in Iowa and Wisconsin.”</p>

<p>And it is because this state of things continues
and has threatened every presidential election
since then, that the brave deed of standing
in the presence of the perpetrators of the
wrong, and unmasking its hideous mien, is still
all the more worthy of notice, and demands an
increased interest; and so we venture to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
another sample of his old Plutarch method of
contrast and comparison; the last few sentences
of the speech, constituting as they did his peroration,
and being so pointed, personal, and triumphant
in tone and manner, revealing the man
so clearly and forcibly, that we close our reference
to the speech with them, and giving a
summary of argument and powerful, homeward
putting of truth, worthy of the honor of the
great cause he pleaded, worthy of the dignity of
the high place in which he spoke, and worthy of
himself:—</p>

<p>“Within that entire great organization there
is not one man, whose opinion is entitled to be
quoted, that does not desire peace and harmony
and friendship, and a patriotic and fraternal union,
between the North and the South. This wish
is spontaneous, instinctive, universal throughout
the Northern states; and yet, among men of
character and sense, there is surely no need of
attempting to deceive ourselves as to the precise
truth. First pure, then peaceable. Gush
will not remove a grievance, and no disguise of
state rights will close the eyes of our people
to the necessity of correcting a great national
wrong. Nor should the South make the fatal
mistake of concluding that injustice to the
negro is not also injustice to the white
man; nor should it ever be forgotten, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
for the wrongs of both a remedy will assuredly
be found.</p>

<p>“The war, with all its costly sacrifices, was
fought in vain unless equal rights for all classes
be established in all the states of the Union;
and now, in words which are those of friendship,
however differently they may be accepted,
I tell the men of the South here on this floor
and beyond this chamber, that even if they
could strip the negro of his constitutional rights,
they can never permanently maintain the inequality
of white men in this nation; they can
never make a white man’s vote in the South
doubly as powerful in the administration of the
government as a white man’s vote in the North.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HESE names will be forever linked together
in American history. Not as
the names of Lincoln and Seward.
They had little in common except massive
powers and a common work, without any
special affinities or friendships other than of a
public and political nature. They were, indeed,
friends in a large sense, and each worthy of the
other, constituting largely the nation’s head, when
the greatness of statesmanship is head, and the
loyalty of statesmanship is heart, was the demand
of the hour. It was the cause and circumstance
that brought their great lives in unison. And
yet we are not told that in any sense they
were like David and Jonathan,—one at heart in
a personal love, as they were one in mind, devoted
to the great concern of the nation’s perpetuity.</p>

<p>But Mr. Garfield and Mr. Blaine, when young
men far from their prime, entered together the
thirty-eighth congress in 1863. Those were dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
days, and side by side they fought out in congress
halls the great battle for Liberty and Right
against Slavery and Wrong. No contest commanded
talent of a higher order. No men supremer
in those great qualities which give to
greatness the sovereign right to dictate the destiny
of mighty interests, and crown, as personal
achievements, those interests with a glory imperishable,—none
better, braver, truer, armed to the
point of triumph, ever stood up against incarnate
wrong, to wage the sharp, decisive engagement to
final conquest, than did these men and their noble
compeers. They entered the lists when the
breath of battle blew hottest, when the land
was darkest with shadows of the war-cloud, when
the nation was saddest from loss of noble sons
by land and sea, when desperation was stamped
in the face of the foe and rankled in his heart.
Like Spartans, there they stood, pouring their
vital energies into the current of the nation’s
life, until the end of war, and all its fruits
were gathered in and secured in safety within
the iron chest of the constitution’s sure protection.</p>

<p>It was not for four years, but for thirteen,
that they thus held each other company in
their high service of the nation and the world.
Such fellowship as this, rich with every element
of honor, could but weld their hearts in unity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
As they grew up into those expansive lives, rare
and fragrant with the choicest gifts of nature,
and rich with deeds worthy of the noblest powers,
so that the highest honors of the nation
seemed theirs, they grew not apart, but together.
Thinking and speaking, writing and contending,
for the same great measures, their lives ran in
the same great channels.</p>

<p>The friendship of soldiers who have toiled and
endured together, is felt by thousands in our
Republic to-day, and the feeling grows deeper
and stronger as the years go by. This is general,
and is common to all, but it is enduring
and sincere. Yet there were special, particular
friendships, more personal in their nature, that
sprang up like beautiful plants, upon this larger
field. These are not forgotten or destroyed.
The strength of life is in them, and the growth
of years is on them. The immortality of time
is theirs. So in the narrower field, when the
life-giving service of years, wrought into the
structure of a nation redeemed, these men added
to the charm and glory of the broader and more
general interest, the grace of a special personal
friendliness.</p>

<p>They were just dissimilar enough for this.
They were both large, strong men in physique,
and yet not large and portly in the sense of
large and needless bulk of flesh; but fine and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
strong frames, with massive heads set squarely
upon broad shoulders; arms that swung with
power; bodies filled with health,—not shrunken,
dwarfed, or withered,—and good, stout limbs, that
held them well in air, and moved with speed
of the same strong will that commanded and
controlled their utterance. There were ease and
grace in every motion. They stood erect and
bore themselves with the dignity of kings, and
yet the merest child was beloved by them. If
the one was deeper and more metaphysical than
the other, that other was broader, richer in
generalization,—marshalling his well-armed troops
of knowledge from every field where Right had
conquered Wrong, and moving his battalions with
the speed of a swifter march. They were never
left to be bitter contestants at any point; neither
had ever plunged the iron into the soul of the
other, or done aught to hinder the cause of
the other’s promotion.</p>

<p>Early in their congressional career they were
both stamped as future candidates for the presidency.
They were so thought of and talked
about. But Mr. Blaine’s prominence as a speaker
of the House of Representatives had given him
earliest the greater prominence in this direction,
and from various quarters it was being thrust
upon him. But they were friends, and had no
bickerings and jealousies on this account. Garfield<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
could wait, and would. He did not put
himself forward, nor seek it at the hands of
friends. He would rather bide his time, and
help another. But that other was not Mr. Blaine,
though they were friends. It was a matter of
honor, of state-pride, and of duty, that he gave
his suffrage and his power to John Sherman, of
his own state of Ohio, who had done such
magnificent service in the treasury in paying
the national debt and resuming specie payment.
And his great, honest speech was so brilliant
and earnest for his friend at home, that it turned
the mind of the convention toward him.</p>

<p>When the crisis came they crowned him, and
on the instant the news was flashed into the
presence of Mr. Blaine, while still the cheers
went up in that great assembly in Chicago; he
sent his congratulations to his friend, and said,
“Command my services for the great campaign.”
They were friends and brothers still, each
worthy of the other’s highest honor, truest devotion,
and fullest praise. Political lying could
not befoul the heart of either with any member
of that brood of vipers which inhabit this sphere
in other breasts. They knew too well the
nature and the tactics of the foe. I have
seen a soldier dead upon the field, so blackened
with blood and powder from the fray,
that three stood by and claimed him for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
their different companies, and none perchance
were right.</p>

<p>But no blackening powder of the enemy, no
mud of march, no dust of camp, or any other
creature, could so bespatter or besmear these
men so they should fail to know and love each
other. The battle had been long and hard, and
desperate to them. Neither could be pierced or
fall without the other’s notice, and full well
they knew that such hard pressure of the
enemy would bring them to desperate straits.
But this did not cause them to fear or falter,
but to rush on, through blinding and begriming
powder-smoke, to victory. They could but smile
at the enemies’ reports of battle, and of the
skill and bearing of both general and troops,
just as when a paper crossed the lines in Rebellion
times the truth came not always with
it. Some one must bear the wrath of those
whose flag was ever in the dust, and whose
broken ranks were reeling in defeat. Hard
names and lies were but the sparks,—the flint
flash from the clash of arms,—they but consume
themselves, then die away. No man, since
all the hate of treason had blackened Lincoln
and our leading men with crimes imaginary,
had had his name politically tarnished with
darker words of calumny than the wise, the
good, the sainted Garfield; and yet Mr. Blaine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
lived so close to him, so well knew the health
and the beauty of his inward life, the strength
and soundness of his character, the boldness of
his purpose, purity of his motive, and the cleanness
of his record,—as history shall record it,—that
his voice resounded as it never had
done, from city to city, from state to state, in
support of the man and in vindication of his
cause; and the wreath was on his brow, and
multitudes stood, with uncovered heads, to do
him honor. His old, tried friends, who had
watched, and studied, and known him for twenty
years had sent him back to congress for the
ninth time. The legislature of Ohio had given
him their suffrage and elevated him spontaneously,
without his presence or his asking, to
the senatorship. The convention had nominated,
and the people elected him to the presidency,
and all despite the flinging of mud and the
breath of slander. “He was met,” says Mr.
Blaine, “with a storm of detraction at the very
hour of his nomination, and it continued with
increasing volume until the close of his victorious
campaign:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“‘No might, nor greatness in mortality,</div>
<div class="verse">Can censure scope; back-wounding calumny.</div>
<div class="verse">The whitest virtue strikes; what king so strong,</div>
<div class="verse">Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Under it all,” he says, “he was calm, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
strong, and confident; never lost his self-possession,
did no unwise act, spoke no hasty or ill-considered
word. Indeed, nothing in his whole
life is more remarkable than his bearing through
those five full months of vituperation. The great
mass of these unjust imputations passed unnoticed,
and with the general <i>débris</i> of the campaign
fell into oblivion.”</p>

<p>The friendship of Mr. Blaine never waned.
He was true as steel. And when the honors
of the nation, who had honored him, were in
Garfield’s hands, the chiefest and the best were
for his first best friend, whom he called to the
highest place in his cabinet,—the <i>premier</i> of the
nation. This was no mere compliment. It was
an official act. The success of his administration,
which was his greatest care, depended
largely upon his secretary of state. He must be
clean as well as competent,—a king in skill and
scholarship, as well as brother, friend. It must
then have been an act of his best judgment, as
well as an expression of regard. And yet it
was as well respect for the millions, represented
by the large and strong delegations who voted
for him with such strength of purpose for five-and-thirty
times.</p>

<p>Four months, less two days, he sat at his
right hand in the highest counsels of the country,
a wise, and honored, and trusted man. He could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
not have been there had not Garfield known
him,—but he did know him through and through,
and because he knew him so thoroughly and
well, he placed the keeping of the nation’s wisdom,
integrity, and honor before the world, and
in the great world abroad, into his hands.</p>

<p>“The heart is wiser than the head,” and
knows more deeply into life and character, than
simple, abstract thought can penetrate. It receives
and knows the whole man as a whole,
knows him as a person in his every element of
personality in reason, conscience, affections, will;
knows him by the touch of moral reason, for
pure intellect may act alone comparatively in abstract
questions, of metaphysical thought, but the
heart never. The true enlightenment is here.
It is the abode of motive, purpose, plan,—out
of it are the issues of life itself.</p>

<p>We are ignorant of those we hate, as the
South was of the North before the war, and
hence her braggart boasts. But those whom we
know deeply, fully, truly, we love deeply, fully,
truly. Love lights the path of reason, when it
carries the whole reason with it, and furnishes
by reciprocal acts of confidence data for its
guidance. And thus we love our way into each
other’s lives, while reason thus enlightened, helps
us on.</p>

<p>It was thus with these great men of the nation’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
hope, her honor, and her trust. They sat,
they stood, they walked, they talked together,
their great hearts open as the day, shining full
upon each other. And as they shone thus on
each other’s life, there was a blending, and so
a mutual life, an interlacing, twining, locking, and
so a unity.</p>

<p>Every walk in life furnishes its friendships;
and the greater the walk may be, the greater
are the friendships; for the greater the affinities,
the broader the sympathies, the purer,
sweeter, more supreme the life; for the true
life is never isolated, but unstarved in every
part. The king has his queen, the Czar his
Czarina. Only the small-souled men are shrunken
hearted, while large, capacious spirits take in
worlds.</p>

<p>Perhaps the country never possessed two men
at the same time who had more friends of the
solid and reliable sort than these men, who admired
and loved to honor, and honored because
they loved, and this because they lived out
their splendid natures before their countrymen,
hating every mean thing, loving and praising
the good. They were not dark, unfathomable
mysteries, enigmas, puzzles, problems, staring at
you, unsolved, and daring you to the thankless
task, and promising but the gloom of deeper
shadows; you felt you knew them. They did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
not stand aloof, daring you mount up to them,
but coming down, they sat beside you, and made
you feel akin, and not blush out your feelings
of a doomed inferiority; and this great-heartedness,
beating responsive to the strong, warm
touch of nature, made them friends.</p>

<p>Garfield did not live to draw the picture of
his Blaine, but Blaine has lived to draw the
picture of his Garfield.</p>

<p>“It is not easy,” he says, “to find his counterpart
anywhere in the record of American
public life. He, perhaps, more nearly resembles
Mr. Seward in his supreme faith in the all-conquering
power of a principle. He had the love
of learning, and patient industry of investigation
to which John Quincy Adams owes his prominence,
and his presidency. He had some of
those ponderous elements of mind which distinguished
Mr. Webster, and which, indeed, in all
our public life, have left the great Massachusetts
senator without an intellectual peer.</p>

<p>“Some of his methods recall the best features
in the strong, independent course of Sir Robert
Peel, to whom he had striking resemblance in
the type of his mind and the habit of his
speech. He had all of Burke’s love for the
sublime and the beautiful, with, possibly, something
of his superabundance. In his faith and
his magnanimity; in his power of statement and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
subtle analysis; in his faultless logic, and his
love of literature; in his wealth and mode of
illustration, one is reminded of that great English
statesman of to-day,—Gladstone.”</p>

<p>But the nation seems to commemorate most
fittingly the friendship of those two men, when
in the person of its representatives and senators
it selects to deliver the eulogy of the dead
president. Not any of his colleagues in the
House from his native state, however long or
well they may have known him; nor his colleague
in the senate; no governor of his honored
state; his loved and cultured pastor, nor
any other man than Blaine,—his chosen counsellor
in the great affairs of state; he who was
with him when, on that quiet, happy morning
in July, they rode slowly to the depot, and
“his fate was on him in an instant. One
moment he stood erect, strong, confident in the
years stretching out peacefully before him;—the
next he lay wounded, bleeding, helpless, doomed
to weary weeks of torture, to silence, and the
grave.”</p>

<p>And now, as the hand of Mr. Blaine draws
aside the curtain, let us look in upon the final
scene in the life and death of his great friend,
and see, as he saw, the man so deeply, truly
loved by the great nation he had just begun to
rule so well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>“Great in life, he was surpassingly great in death.
For no cause, in the very frenzy of wantonness and
wickedness, by the red hand of murder, he was
thrust from the full tide of this world’s interest;
from its hopes, its aspirations, its victories, into the
visible presence of death, and he did not quail.
Not alone for the one short moment in which,
stunned and dazed, he could give up life, hardly
aware of its relinquishment; but through days of
deadly languor; through weeks of agony, that was
not less agony because silently borne; with clear
sight and calm courage he looked into his open
grave. What blight and ruin met his anguished eyes,
whose lips may tell? What brilliant, broken plans;
what baffled high ambitions; what sundering of strong,
warm manhood’s friendships; what bitter rending of
sweet household ties! Behind him a proud, expectant
nation; a great host of sustaining friends; a cherished
and happy mother, wearing the full, rich honors
of her early toil and tears; the wife of his youth,
whose whole life lay in his; the little boys not yet
emerged from childhood’s day of frolic; the fair,
young daughter; the sturdy sons, just springing into
closest companionship, claiming every day and every
hour the reward of a father’s love and care; and in
his heart the eager, rejoicing power to meet all demands.
Before him, desolation and great darkness!
And his soul was not shaken.</p>

<p>“His countrymen were thrilled with instant, profound,
and universal sympathy. Masterful in his
mortal weakness, he became the centre of a nation’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
love; enshrined in the prayers of a world. But all
the love and all the sympathy could not share with
him his suffering. He trod the wine-press alone.
With unfaltering front he faced death. With unfailing
tenderness he took leave of life. Above the demoniac
hiss of the assassin’s bullet he heard the voice
of God. With simple resignation he bowed to the
divine decree.</p>

<p>“As the end drew near, his early craving for the
sea returned. The stately mansion of power had
been to him the wearisome hospital of pain, and he
begged to be taken from its prison walls, from its
oppressive, stifling air, from its homelessness, and its
hopelessness. Gently, silently, the love of a great
people bore the pale sufferer to the longed-for healing
of the sea, to live or to die, as God should
will, within sight of its heaving billows, within hearing
of its manifold voices. With wan, fevered face tenderly
lifted to the cooling breeze, he looked out
wistfully upon the ocean’s changing wonders; on its
far sails, whitening in the morning light; on its restless
waves, rolling shoreward to break and die
beneath the noonday sun; on the red clouds of
evening, arching low to the horizon; on the serene
and shining pathway of the stars. Let us believe
that in the silence of the receding world he heard
the great waves breaking on a further shore, and
felt, already upon his wasted brow, the breath of the
eternal morning.”</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">M</span>R. BLAINE was a member of the
cabinets of President Garfield and of
President Arthur for ten months,
retiring at his own request, in January,
1881.</p>

<p>The Foreign Policy of the Garfield administration,
as conducted by Mr. Blaine, was emphatically
a Peace Policy. It was without the
motive or disposition of war in any form. It
was one of dignity and uprightness, as a work
of twelve hundred and fifty pages, entitled “Foreign
Relations of the United States for 1881,”
and another book entitled “War in South America,
and attempt to bring about Peace, 1880-81,”
a book of about eight hundred pages, both
printed by the United States Government, and
now before us, amply testify.</p>

<p>Its two objects, as distinctly stated by him,
were: first, to bring about peace, and prevent
future wars in North and South America; second,
to cultivate such friendly commercial relations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
with all American countries as would increase
the export trade of the United States, by
supplying those fabrics in which we are abundantly
able to compete with the manufacturing
nations of Europe.</p>

<p>The second depended on the first. For three
years Chili, Peru, and Bolivia had been engrossed
in war, and the friendly offices of the United
States Government had barely averted it between
Chili and the Argentine Republic, postponed it
between Guatemala and Mexico; so also it might
in these South American Republics. War was
threatened between Brazil and Uruguay, and foreshadowed
between Brazil and the Argentine states.</p>

<p>To induce the Spanish American states to
adopt some peaceful mode of adjusting their frequently
recurring contentions, was regarded by
President Garfield as one of the most honorable
and useful ends to which the diplomacy of the
United States could contribute; and in the line
of the policy indicated, is a letter from Mr.
Blaine to Gen. S. A. Hurlbut, United States
Minister to Peru. While it shows the spirit of
the president, it shows as well the hand and
heart of his secretary:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="indentright2">“<span class="smcap">Department of State</span>,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, June 15, 1881.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:—The deplorable condition of Peru, the disorganization
of its government, and the absence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
precise and trustworthy information as to the state
of affairs now existing in that unhappy country, render
it impossible to give you instructions as full and
definite as I would desire.</p>

<p>“Judging from the most recent despatches from
our ministers, you will probably find on the part of
the Chilian authorities in possession of Peru, a willingness
to facilitate the establishment of the provisional
government which has been attempted by Senor
Calderon. If so you will do all you properly can
to encourage the Peruvians to accept any reasonable
conditions and limitations with which this concession
may be accompanied. It is vitally important to Peru,
that she be allowed to resume the functions of a
native and orderly government, both for the purposes
of internal administration and the negotiation of peace.
To obtain this end it would be far better to accept
conditions which may be hard and unwelcome, than
by demanding too much to force the continuance of
the military control of Chili. It is hoped that you
will be able, in your necessary association with the
Chilian authorities, to impress upon them that the
more liberal and considerate their policy, the surer
it will be to obtain a lasting and satisfactory settlement.
The Peruvians cannot but be aware of the
sympathy and interest of the people and government
of the United States, and will, I feel confident, be
prepared to give to your representations the consideration
to which the friendly anxiety of this government
entitles them.</p>

<p>“The United States cannot refuse to recognize the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
rights which the Chilian government has acquired by
the successes of the war, and it may be that a cession
of territory will be the necessary price to be
paid for peace....</p>

<p>“As a strictly confidential communication, I inclose
you a copy of instructions sent this day to the
United States minister at Santiago. You will thus
be advised of the position which this government
assumes toward all the parties to this deplorable
conflict. It is the desire of the United States to
act in a spirit of the sincerest friendship to the
three republics, and to use its influence solely in the
interest of an honorable and lasting peace.</p>

<p class="right">“JAMES G. BLAINE.”</p>
</div>

<p>The appointment of William Henry Trescot
as Spanish envoy, with the rank of Minister
Plenipotentiary to the republics of Chili, Peru,
and Bolivia, was done in the same regard, not
only of the nation’s honor, but also of peace
and that commerce which brings prosperity and
happiness.</p>

<p>It has long been felt, and is felt deeply to-day,
that there are many kindly offices of state
which this great nation may offer to weaker,
feebler, and distressed peoples, for their good
and for our glory; that it is not enough to
be simply an example and an asylum, but to
be a potent benefactor in a direct and personal
way, teaching them that peace, not war, is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
secret of growth and greatness. This, in effect,
was the object of the peace congress, which
was a cherished design of the administration,
and to which Mr. Blaine was fully committed.</p>

<p>No wonder that such a project commanded
the thought and enlisted the sympathies of
such men as Garfield and his great <i>premier</i>;
and Mr. Blaine tells us that it was the intention,
resolved on before the fatal shot of July
2d, to invite all the independent governments of
North and South America to meet in such a
congress at Washington, on March 15, 1882,
and the invitations would have been issued
directly after the New England tour the president
was not permitted to make. But the invitations
were sent out by Mr. Blaine on the
22d of November, when in Mr. Arthur’s cabinet.
It met with cordial approval in South American
countries, and some of them at once accepted
the invitations. But in six weeks President Arthur
caused the invitations to be recalled, or
suspended, and referred the whole matter to
congress, where it was lost in debate, just as
the Panama congress was wrecked when Mr.
Clay was secretary of state over fifty years ago.</p>

<p>It was argued that such an assemblage of
representatives from those various states would
not only elevate their standard of civilization,
and lead to the fuller development of a continent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
at whose wealth Humboldt was amazed, but
it would also bring them nearer us and turn
the drift of their European trade to our American
shores. As it is, they have a coin balance
of trade against us every year, of one hundred
and twenty millions of dollars, and this money
is shipped from our country to Europe, to pay
for their immense purchases there. Their petroleum
comes from us, but crosses the Atlantic
twice before it gets to them, and the middle-men
in Europe receive a larger profit on it
than the producers of the oil in north-western
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>It may be both wise and prudent, in order
to completeness of biography, to state two
aspersions,—one of war, and the other of gain,—cast
upon the policy of Mr. Blaine.</p>

<p>William Henry Trescot, in a published letter
dated July 17, 1882, states “his knowledge of
certain matters connected with Mr. Blaine’s administration
as secretary of state”:—</p>

<p>“2. As to your designing a war, that supposition
is too absurd for serious consideration. If
you had any such purpose it was carefully concealed
from me, and I left for South America
with the impression that I would utterly fail in
my mission if I did not succeed in obtaining an
<i>amicable settlement of the differences</i> between the
belligerents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>“3. In regard to the Cochet and Landreau
claims, it is sufficient to say that you rejected
the first, absolutely. As to the second, you instructed
General Hurlbut to ask, if the proper
time for such request should come, that Landreau
might be heard before a Peruvian tribunal
in support of his claim.</p>

<p>“General Hurlbut, although approving the justice
of Landreau’s claim in his dispatch of Sept.
14, 1881, never brought it in any way to the
notice of the Peruvian government. During my
mission in South America, I never referred to
it, so that, in point of fact, during your secretaryship
the Landreau claim was never mentioned
by ministers of the United States, either to the
Chilian or Peruvian government. It could not,
therefore, have affected the then pending diplomatic
questions in the remotest degree.”</p>

<p>But for these he appeared and answered, in
company with Mr. Trescot, before the House
committee on foreign affairs, Hon. Charles G.
Williams, of Wisconsin, chairman.</p>

<p>“He received a vindication,” is the simple
report.</p>

<p>“I think Mr. Blaine has rather enjoyed his
opportunity, and his triumph,” writes one. “It
is inspiring to have Mr. Blaine associated with
public affairs again, if only as a witness before
a committee. How the country rings with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
name, the moment he breaks silence! His
familiar face, framed in rapidly whitening hair;
his elastic figure, growing almost venerable, from
recent associations; his paternal manner toward
young Jimmie, his name-sake son, whom by
some whim of fancy, he had with him during
the examination,—all these were elements of
interest in the picture.”</p>

<p>And now comes a beautiful prophecy, two
years old, which shows how one may argue his
way into the future by the hard and certain logic
of events. It is this: “The administration will
have to do something that shall appeal strongly
to the popular heart; something out of the line
of hospitalities within its own charmed circle;
something magnetic and heroic, or else ‘Blaine,
of Maine,’ will become so idolized in the minds
of the people that he will be invincible in
1884.”</p>

<p>In all of his foreign correspondence there is,
in one particular, a striking likeness between
Mr. Blaine and President Lincoln,—the man is
not lost in the statesman, but rather the man
is the statesman.</p>

<p>As Abraham Lincoln in all his giant form
appears upon the forefront of every public document
that came from his hand, so James G.
Blaine is photographed from life in every state-paper
that bears his name. He copies no model,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
he stands on no pedestal,—his personality is
free and untrammeled in every utterance.</p>

<p>In his paper to Mr. Lowell, our Minister to
England, of Nov. 29, 1881, we get a full view
of the man at his work.</p>

<p>A modification of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty of
April 19, 1850, is the subject in hand. His
instructions had been sent ten days before. A
week afterwards the response of Lord Granville
to his circular note of June 24, in relation to
the neutrality of any canal across the Isthmus
of Panama, had been received.</p>

<p>And so he proceeded to give a summary of
the historical objections to the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty, and the very decided differences of opinion
between the two governments, to which its
interpretation has given rise. And this he does
with singular skill and aptness, which is not
unusual to him, when the philosophy of history
is needful as the servant of his genius.</p>

<p>No less than sixteen direct quotations of from
two to eight lines each, are given in a letter of
six large pages, taken from the discussion of the
subject for thirty years, while the main body of
the letter, in its various parts, shows a comprehensive
grasp of details, a familiarity with
utterances of the leading men of the past, and
with England’s operations under the treaty, as
to prove conclusively that in the highest realms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
of statesmanship, mastery is still the one word
that defines the man.</p>

<p>His previous letter of instructions, presenting
an analysis of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, singling
out the objectionable features to be abrogated,
and stating his reasons, is of the same clear,
strong type, compactly written, and applying the
great arguments of common sense to a subject
of international importance.</p>

<p>“The convention,” he says, “was made more
than thirty years ago, under exceptional and extraordinary
conditions, which have long since
ceased to exist,—conditions which at best were
temporary in their nature, and which can never
be reproduced.</p>

<p>“The development of the Pacific coast places
responsibility upon our government which it
cannot meet, and not control the canal now
building, and just as England controls the Suez
canal.</p>

<p>“England requires and sustains an immense
navy, for which we have no use, and might at
any time seize the canal, and make it impossible
for us to marshal a squadron in Pacific waters,
without a perilous voyage ourselves around the
Horn.”</p>

<p>Great events of permanent importance would
doubtless have been the result, had the president
and his secretary been permitted to continue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
as they were for the full term of office.
Already Mr. Blaine was showing himself a master
in the arts of diplomacy, not with aught of
cunning artifice or sly interrogation, but with
straight-forward, solid utterances upon the great
interests of the nation’s weal. Not only of the
loved and honored president did the assassin’s
bullet deprive us, but also of the services of
Mr. Blaine, as well. A Providence more kind
seems to be giving him back to the nation, to
complete their unfinished work.</p>

<small>HOME LIFE OF MR. BLAINE.</small></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dci.jpg" width="77" height="75" alt="I">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>N his “Letters to the Joneses” J. G.
Holland describes various homes as
possessing all the elements of an empire,
a kingdom, a monarchy, or a
republic. Mr. Blaine’s home is a republic.
Every member of his family seems to be on an
absolute equality; and he, as one, has described
him, and an intimate friend confirmed it, is
more like a big brother than aught beside.
Certainly he is no emperor, no monarch, czar,
or king. He is not even president or governor,
nor chieftain there, or general; but rather the
senior member of the family, the head by right
of priority. He is there deeply loved, greatly
respected, and highly honored. Why need he be
a tyrant where a father’s wisdom and a father’s
love will serve him best and win high encomiums
of praise? Why not shine on when he
enters there, as well as in the places of the
state and nation, or in the simpler walks and
haunts of men? Why put out his light when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
among those who most admire and love? Why
ring down the curtain upon all those splendid
qualities of soul that make him famous in the
world abroad, when in the charmed circle of
those who love and share his fame and
honor?</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine’s first home in Augusta was the
eastern half of a large, brown, double house, on
Green Street, nearly opposite the Methodist
church. It was a simple, unpretentious, pleasant
home, all through his editorial, legislative, and
on into his congressional life. It was where he
did the hard work of those first years, where
he made his friends and bound them to him,
where he entertained them and gave them cheer.
His business was a constant thing with him;
he never quit or laid it aside; and it was a
great part of his business to get acquainted.
He took them to his home; it was open to all,
and there was a seat for any and all at his
table. He kept open house the year around.
When friends came it was hard to get away;
he would hold on to them as he would to a
book. He loved the people; they were a study
to him; a very joy and pleasure, a real delight.
Among the people he is perfectly at home, and
they are made to feel that “come and see me”
means just that, and all that that means. He
is like a father or big brother out among them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
They all knew him, and knew where he lived,—in
that “brown house on Green Street.”
This was back in those years before he was so
largely in Washington, and before he had his
pleasant and more commodious house and
grounds near the capitol.</p>

<p>The whole care of the home was upon Mrs.
Blaine, who looked after everything down to
the veriest <i>minutiæ</i>. She was thoroughly in
sympathy with him, was pleased with what he
enjoyed; and so was perfectly willing their
home should be the rallying-place for his hosts
of friends, who might come and go at will.
The Maine legislature met at his house during
the Garcelon trouble.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine attended strictly to his work, and
that meant the people,—strangers, and townspeople,
one and all. He never, I am credibly
informed, bought a pound of steak in his life,
nor a barrel of flour; never went to a grocery
store to buy anything. He has had no time or
thought for things like these. He has been a
student and teacher all his life; a close, deep,
careful reader and thinker. He had never been
in a printing-office in his life until he became
editor, and had to learn the people, study them,
get politics from their ways of thinking and
looking at things; and it was a matter of principle
with him to make the thing go. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
not a half-dozen things, but “This one thing I
do,” with him, and he does it. But he has
always been regular at his meals, as a matter
of health, and so a law of life. He was no
epicurean; cared only for the more substantial
things of diet, and never seemed to be particular
about what he ate, except one thing, and
that he liked, and always wanted them in their
season, and always had them. It was baked
sweet apples and milk at the close of every
meal. And then he would sit and read, and
read, and read, especially after supper, and Mrs.
Blaine, if she wanted him to move from the
table, would say, “James! James!” and again,
“James!” like enough half a dozen times before
he would hear, and she pleasant and careful
of him all the time. She has had mind and
heart to know his worth, and has needed no
one to tell her that teaching school in Kentucky
has paid her a handsome dividend and is full
of promise for the future. He has made no
move but what she has seconded the motion.
Her life is in his, and not a thing independent
and apart from it.</p>

<p>One who knew her well in those early years,
and knows her well to-day, said of Mrs. Blaine,
“She is just as lovely as she can be; of superior
culture, and a real, true mother.”</p>

<p>The gentleman who was Mr. Blaine’s foreman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
and for a year and a half made his home with
them, is most enthusiastic in their praise. He
tells what a real mother Mrs. Blaine was to
him if he was sick, or anything the matter with
him, how she would take the best of care of
him. Every winter they published a tri-weekly
during the session of the legislature, and this
kept him at the office late every-other night,
and she would be “worried about him because
he had to work nights,” and Mr. Blaine would
say, “Howard, you are worth a dozen boys
(shiftless, good-for-nothing boys, he meant), but
you must not work so hard.” The humanities
of life were the amenities to them.</p>

<p>This same man, who has since been editor
and proprietor of Mr. Blaine’s old paper, said
with depth of feeling, and strong emphasis, “I
wish every voter in America had had my opportunity
for eighteen months, right in his own
home, to see and know Mr. Blaine, they would
find out then what a royal man he is.”</p>

<p>In less than ten days after his nomination,
parties of prominence, connected with a paper
favorable to his election, but located in quite a
city where a leading Republican paper affects
to oppose him, visited Augusta, and called upon
his political enemies, and enquired into his private,
social, and domestic life, and they finally
confessed there was no lisp or syllable of aught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
to tarnish his name or cause a blush. It is all
pure, and sweet, and clear.</p>

<p>When Mr. and Mrs. Blaine first entered their
Augusta home, a bright and beautiful baby boy
was in the arms of Mrs. Blaine. He was the
pride and joy of the home, their first-born. His
name was Stanwood Blaine, taking his mother’s
maiden-name. One short, bright year of sunshine,
and prattle, and glee, and a dark cloud
rested on that home; a deep sorrow stung the
life of that father, and heavy grief oppressed
the heart of the mother,—their little Stanwood
was gone; he was among the jewels on high,
and there he is to-day, while a lovely picture
of him adorns the present home.</p>

<p>Since then, six children have been born to
them,—John Walker, a graduate of Yale college,
and a member of the Alabama Court of
Claims; Robert Emmons, a graduate of Harvard
college, now connected with the North-western
Railroad, in Chicago; Alice, the wife of Colonel
Coppinger; Margaret; James Gillespie, Jr., and
Hattie, named for her mother, Harriet. Walker,
the oldest, is about thirty-one years old, and
unmarried. Hattie, the youngest, is fourteen
years of age. All of the children have been
born in Augusta, and with but two or three
exceptions, in the old home on Green Street.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine has been accustomed to sit up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
quite late at night with books, papers, and letters,
and make up his sleep in the morning.
He loves a good story, and keeps a fund on
hand constantly, and they serve his purpose
well. There is one he has enjoyed telling to
knots of friends here and there, and especially
when friends have gathered at his table. The
Maine law, in the interest of temperance, was a
leading issue in the state during Mr. Blaine’s
connection with the <i>Journal</i>. It fell to the lot
of his partner, John L. Stevens, who had been
a minister, to write the temperance articles, and
he would write them long and strong. It was
a custom with Mr. Blaine to go around among
the workmen and chat with them, a few words
of good cheer. Among them was an Irishman
named John Murphy, who loved his glass. He
was a witty fellow, and generally had something
to say. One day while Mr. Blaine was around,
Murphy had a large, long manuscript from Mr.
Stevens, on temperance, which he was setting
up in type. It was a hard job, and the day
was hot. He was about half through, when he
called out to the foreman,—</p>

<p>“Owen, have you a quarter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! What do you want of it?”</p>

<p>All were listening, including Mr. Blaine, for
they expected something bright and sharp.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I thought I would have to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
after having something to wet me throat wid
before I got through with this long, dry temperance
job.”</p>

<p>Everybody roared at the Irishman’s quaint
sally. It struck Mr. Blaine as particularly dry
and ludicrous; he laughed outright, and he
would tell it as a good joke on his partner.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine has never talked about people behind
their backs; he is no gossiper. He is a
fearless man, and if he has anything to say to
a man he says it squarely to his face. There
is a purity of tone and richness of life in his
home, that are both noticeable and remarkable.
There seem to be no frictions, gratings, or
harshness. One of ample opportunity has said,
“I never heard him speak a cross word to his
children.” He is rather indulgent than otherwise.
While he may be, as case requires, the
strong, central government, they are as sovereign
states; no rebellion manifests itself, requiring
coercion.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine’s family have been accustomed to
attend church, and the family pew is always
full. Father and mother are both members of
the Congregational Church, and have the reputation
of being devoted Christians and liberal
supporters of the church. Mr. Blaine tells them
to put down what they want from him, and he
will pay it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>He has the reputation of being one of the
best Bible-class teachers in the city. His long
drill at college, reading the New Testament
through in Greek several times, has helped him
in this. A Mission Sabbath-school was started
down in the lower part of Augusta, and he
went down with the others and taught a large
Bible-class. His old pastors, Doctor Ecob, of
Albany, N. Y., and Doctor Webb, of Boston,
Mass., bear the highest testimony to his Christian
character and integrity. It was said of
him at Cincinnati, that “he needed no certificate
of moral character from a Rebel congress,”
and a very careful examination proves it true.
No man could, it would seem, by any possibility,
stand better in his own home community
than does Mr. Blaine. It is not simply cold,
formal endorsement, as a matter of self-respect
and state-pride, but the clear, strong words of
a deep and powerful friendship, that one constantly
hears who will stand in the light and
let it shine on him.</p>

<p>There were in his Green-street home, parlor,
sitting-room, dining-room, and kitchen, down-stairs,
and corresponding rooms up-stairs. There was
quite a large side-yard, with numerous trees, and
garden in the rear. The barn and rear part of
the house were connected by a long wood-house,
as is the custom in New England. It was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
ample and respectable place for a young editor
and politician to reside, and while it was up on
the hill or low bluff from Water Street, down
near the Kennebec River, where the business portion
of the city was, and his office was located,
still it was quite convenient for him.</p>

<p>His old office was burned in the big fire of
1865, which destroyed the business portion of the
city, but the desk was saved at which he did
much of his writing when in charge of the office
of the <i>Journal</i> during the presidential campaign
of 1860.</p>

<p>During this campaign there was so much to
excite him, so much news to read, so many
speeches to make, so many ways to go, and
such a general monopoly of time and attention,
that very early in the morning they would get
out of “copy.” The foreman would say,—and
he was a very kind-hearted man, and loved Mr.
Blaine,—</p>

<p>“I don’t see any way for you to do, Dan,
but to go up to Mr. Blaine’s, and wake him up,
and tell him we must have some more copy.”</p>

<p>Up he would go to the Green-street home,
and rouse him up. Mr. Blaine would come down
in his study-gown and slippers and say,—</p>

<p>“What, that copy given out?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and we will have to have more
right away!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>“Well, what did he do, sit right down and
dash it off for you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sometimes, and sometimes he would take
the scissors.”</p>

<p>This was said with a mild, significant smile.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine could write anywhere, and did
much of it out in the dining-room on the supper-table,
with his family all about him. He
would become oblivious of all surroundings, and
with his power of penetration and concentration,
adapt himself to his work, utterly lost to circumstances.</p>

<p>He had no mercy on meanness. It roused his
whole nature. He would walk the floor at home,
plan his articles, think out his sentences, and
send everything to the printer just as he had
written it first,—but when he came to correct
the proof he would erase and interline until the
article had passed almost beyond the power of
recognition. His finishing touches were a new
creation.</p>

<p>Of course the poor printers never said anything
either solemn or wise at such times,
especially when driven to the final point of
desperation. But they could not get mad
at him, and there was no use trying. Dan
said,—</p>

<p>“He would just as soon shake hands with a
man dressed up as I am now, with this old suit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
of overalls on, and sit down and talk with him
as with the richest man in town.”</p>

<p>“The men knew this, and saw and felt his
power. He looked at the man, and not at the
clothes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is just it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine’s business and home-life are so
blended, it is impossible to separate them. He
never left his business at the office. It was all
hours and every hour with him, except upon the
Sabbath.</p>

<p>He took some time to look after the education
of his children, something as his father and
grandfather had dealt with him. But Mrs. Blaine,
having been a teacher, took this responsibility
upon herself. They all attended the public
schools of the city, and were early sent away to
academy, college, and seminary. The home always
had an air of intelligence. Busy scenes
with books were common, day and night. Materials
for writing, papers, magazines, and books for
general reading, and for review, seemed omnipresent.
There is order and system amid all the
seeming confusion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blaine’s hand and touch are felt and seen
everywhere. She is a large, magnificent woman,
a born queen, as fit to rule America as Queen
Victoria to rule England. She has a quiet, commanding
air, with nothing assumed or affected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
about her. A gentle, wholesome dignity makes
her a stranger to storms, and her clear, strong
mind makes her ready and at home in society.
She is not a great talker, and encourages it in
others by listening only when it is sensible. She
is too wise and womanly to ever gush, and never
encourages talk about her husband. There is
nothing patronizing about her.</p>

<p>The fact is, the presidency, since the death
of Mr. Garfield, and the terrible ordeal through
which they then passed, has been very serious
business to them. They have not labored for it.
It has been thrust upon them,—for they are
one in every sympathy and every joy.</p>

<p>About a year ago, while calling upon his
old friend, Ex-Gov. Anson P. Morrill, Mr. Morrill
said,—</p>

<p>“Are you going to try for the presidency
again, Blaine? Come, now, tell me, right out.
I want to know.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” was the reply. “I do not want it.
If you could offer it to me to-night, I would
not accept it. I am devoted to my book at
present, and love it, and do not wish to be diverted
from it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morrill went on to say, that “eight years
ago, when they tried to nominate him at Cincinnati,
I was opposed to it, and told my neighbor,
Mr. Stevens, I would not vote for him. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
thought he was too young, and had not grown
enough.”</p>

<p>“Well, how is it now?”</p>

<p>“O, he is all right now, well-developed, solid,
and strong. The nation can’t do better than put
him right in. He will make a master president,
and give the country an administration they will
be proud of.”</p>

<p>This shows the honor and honesty of the old
governor, and that he loved the nation above
his friend. The happy, blessed, prosperous years
of home-life ended on Green Street, when Mr.
Blaine was advanced to the third office in the
nation, as speaker of the House of Representatives
in congress,—and they removed to the
larger home, with ampler grounds, on State
Street, next to the capitol. Here they have
since resided, except when living in Washington.
Mr. Blaine loves home, and has his family with
him.</p>

<p>There is nothing extravagant about the home
on State Street, either in the house or its furnishing.
It is plain, simple, and comfortable.
The sitting-room and dining-room upon the right
of the main hall, and the two parlors on the
left are thrown into one, making two large
rooms, which have always been serviceable for
entertaining company, but never more so than
since his nomination for the presidency. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
hallway extends into a large, new house, more
modern in appearance than the house proper,
erected by Mr. Blaine for his library, gymnasium,
etc. Mr. Blaine is careful about his exercise,
and practises with dumb-bells, takes walks,
rides, etc.</p>

<p>He has a large barn for horses, and generally
keeps a number of them. The house is of Corinthian
architecture, without a trace of Gothic.
Corinthian columns, two on each side, indicate
the old division of the large room on the left
of the hallway into the front and back parlor,
but all trace of doors is removed, and they are
practically one. A large bay-window, almost a
conservatory, built square, in keeping with the
house, looks out upon the lawn.</p>

<p>It is, all in all, a very convenient, home-like
place, with nothing pretentious or to terrify the
most plebeian who would care to enter, and they
have been there by the score and hundred. Not
less than a thousand friends, neighbors, and visitors
were cordially invited to come in and shake
hands with General Logan, when he visited Mr.
Blaine soon after the convention that nominated
them, and received a quiet serenade, declining
any public reception.</p>

<p>A bright, important feature of Mr. Blaine’s
home is his cousin, “Gail Hamilton,”—Miss
Abigail Dodge,—the gifted authoress. She is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
an intellectual companion, and an important factor
in the social and home-life of the family,
deeply interested, but with native good grace,
in all that pertains to the honor and welfare of
her distinguished relatives. Books, music, bric-a-brac,
abound in their present home.</p>

<p>They do not “fare sumptuously every day,”
though feasts of course there are, but continue
in their simple, democratic ways. Eating is not
a chief business in that home. The children
are very intelligent, and minds, rather than
stomachs, have premiums on them. When
Walker was a little fellow, long before he could
read, less than two years old, he could turn to
any picture in a large book; he knew them all.
But none of them have surpassed, or equalled,
their father’s work at books,—going through
those great lives of Plutarch by the time he
was nine years old,—and this we hear from Mrs.
Blaine herself. Only the three younger are at
home,—Margaret, James Gillespie, Jr., and Hattie,
who, although she is the baby, wears
glasses. She is a wide-awake and pleasant
child, and finds so much of life as is now a
daily experience, a burden rather than a delight.
James has many of his father’s characteristics,
it is said. He is a tall, noble, manly fellow,
and, though still in his teens, has been tutoring
in Washington the past winter. Margaret,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
older than Hattie or James, has achieved a
national reputation by a dexterous use of the
telephone at the time of her father’s nomination.
She was the first to receive the intelligence.
She has mature, womanly ways, and is very
like her mother, though the children all
resemble their father,—have his strong, marked
features,—unless it may be Emmons or Alice.</p>

<p>Alice was the oldest daughter, and would
accompany, with perhaps other members of the
family, Mrs. Blaine herself, at times, back in
the editorial days, upon the press-excursions.
Upon those occasions Mr. Blaine was in his
glory, full of facts, full of life, and full of
stories. There was none of the wag or loafer
about him; he was never idle or obsequious;
but he knew all about the bright side of
things, and never failed to find it. His own
life seemed to light up all around him. The
ludicrous side was as funny as the mean was
despicable. He was very popular among the
journalists of the state. He was an honor to
the craft, and they felt it, and easily recognized
him as a royal good fellow,—a sort of leader or
representative man. He was called out when
toasts were to be responded to or speeches to
be made, and was the captivating man on all
occasions. The crowd gathered about him. He
never would tell a story but that any lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
might listen to it without a blush. They were
well selected, and always first-class, and told in
the shortest, sharpest manner possible. He
would never spin a long yarn. It must be
quickly told, and to the point, and have a
special fitness for the occasion.</p>

<p>A story that he enjoyed hugely, and could
tell with a gusto inimitable, was of a country-man
elected to the legislature, and for the
first time stopping at a large hotel. The waiters
were busy, and while he awaited his turn he
observed a dish of red peppers in front; taking
one of them on his fork, he put it in his
mouth, and began the work of mastication. All
eyes were turned on him. The process was a
brief one, and he very soon raised his fair-sized
hand, and, taking that pepper from his
mouth, laid it beside his plate, and said, as he
drew in a long breath to cool off his blistered
tongue, “You lie thar until you cool!” This
was only matched by one regarding a man
from the interior, at a hotel-table in St. Louis,
who, observing a glass of iced-milk on the
outer circle of dishes that surrounded the plate
of a gentleman opposite to him, reached for it
and swallowed it down. The gentleman watched
him closely, and, with some expression of astonishment,
said simply,—</p>

<p>“That’s cool!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>“Ya-as,” the fellow blustered out, “of course
it is; thar’s ice in it!”</p>

<p>Few toasts touch the heart of Mr. Blaine
more deeply than the great toast of the family
and of friendship, and one to which he could
respond with the happiest grace and the liveliest
good cheer, “Here’s to those we love, and
those who love us! God bless them!”</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine drinks no liquors, not even the
lightest kinds of wine, I am credibly informed
by one who was with him on those occasions,
and frequently at his table.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blaine, like her husband, is a great
reader, and while a devoted mother and faithful
wife, never neglecting her home, husband, or
her children, has kept herself well informed, and
is intelligent and attractive in conversation.</p>

<p>Old friends say, “I do love to hear Mrs.
Blaine talk; she has a fine mind, is so well
educated, and so well informed.”</p>

<p>An old school-mate testifies that she was a
fine scholar when at the academy over the river
from her present home, and that she also studied
and finished her education at Ipswich.</p>

<p>She has trained her children with a skill that
few mothers could command. Her children are
her jewels, and are loved with a mother’s affection.
They are as stars, while her husband is as
the great sun shining in the heaven of her joys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>The present Augusta home has been, for years,
little more than a summer-resort, to which they
have come the first of June. Their great home
has been in Washington. This, for twenty years,
has been life’s centre to them. Here home-life
has reached its zenith; its glories have shone the
brightest; it has been at the nation’s capital, and
husband and father among the first men of the
nation. Wealth has been at their command, to
make that home all they desired. They could
fill it with the realizations of their choicest
ideals, and friends, almost worshipers, have come
and gone with the days and hours, from all
parts of the nation. They have lived in the
nation’s life. They have been in the onward
drift and trend of things, ever on the foremost
wave, caught in the onward rush of events.
Life has been of the intensest kind, rich in all
that enriches, noble in all that ennobles. They
have occupied a large place in the nation, and
the nation has occupied a large place in them;
and yet, though at the very farthest remove from
the quiet, simple life of the cottage or the farm,
it has been an American home; it could be no
other with such a united head, and retains much
of the old simplicity. The habits of early life
are still on them, and in nothing are they estranged
from the people.</p>

<p>It has been an experience with them so long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
and came on so early in its beginnings, and
gradually, that they have become accustomed to
honor and distinction.</p>

<p>Another home is likely to be theirs in Washington,
the crown of all the others. But in it
they will be the same they are now; just as
glad to see their friends, as home-like as themselves,
as genuine and true. Their heads cannot
be turned if they have not been, and home in
the White House will be, if in reserve for them,
the same dear, restful, cheerful spot, for the
loved ones will be there, and that makes home,
not walls, and floor, and furniture.</p>

<p>Photographs of the family abound at Mr.
Blaine’s, all except the picture of Mrs. Blaine,—she
has not had it taken. “They are not true,”
she says, and she brought a half-dozen of her
husband, and only one seemed good, and she
admitted it. The others showed, I thought, how
terrific has been the conflict of life with him.
They show him when haggard and worn, and
perhaps prove, by her judgment on them, how
consummate is her ideal of the man of her heart.
Mr. Blaine loves the open air. The hammock,
seen in the back-ground of the picture of his
house, is soothing and restful to him, and to a man
of such incessant activity rest is very welcome.
He was out in the hammock, as shown in the
picture of his home, with his family and some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
of his nearest neighbors about him, when the
balloting was going on in Chicago. The third ballot
had just been taken when his neighbor, Mr.
Hewins, came on the grounds.</p>

<p>“Well, Charley,” he said, “you don’t see anybody
badly excited about here, do you?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Blaine,” he said, “was the coolest one
of the company.”</p>

<p>These lawn-scenes are a part of the home-life,
a very large and pleasant part; for there
are no pleasanter grounds in Augusta than
those surrounding Mr. Blaine’s modest mansion.</p>

<small>CHARACTERISTICS OF MR. BLAINE.</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dci.jpg" width="77" height="75" alt="I">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>N conversation with a leading business
man in Maine, the question was asked,
“What are the chief characteristics of
Mr. Blaine?” The man was well situated
to know, and well fitted to comprehend,
although he was not the man to analyze character,
except in a general way, and largely from
a business point of view. His answer was,—</p>

<p>“His immense industry; his great enlightenment,
and he has always been a growing man!
He has such great force of character, and such
large intellectual power, and then he is such a
social man. He knows so much, and is so interesting
in conversation. He will talk to a peasant
so that he will take it all in, and a prince
sitting by will enjoy it.”</p>

<p>Captain Lincoln and his wife, New England
people, but from the Sandwich Islands, where
he had been for some five years in charge of a
vessel, called to see him about the middle of
June, to pay their congratulations; and it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
pleasant to observe, how, without a trace of aristocracy,
but with a genuine manliness, he sat down
just like a brother, and talked with them of their
interests, the Island and ocean affairs, and observed,
“They don’t have any more roast missionary
out there now”; but this was slipped
into a sentence that almost gave a history of
the Islands. And as he discussed ocean problems,
routes to Mexico, and different parts of
America, North and South, the captain’s eyes
opened with admiration. And it was not a display
of knowledge, but brought out in questions,
as to what do you think of such a project, and
in stating a few brief reasons for it, the man’s
information not only cropped out, but burst
forth. He seems so full of it, that when it can
find a vent it comes forth in deluge fashion,
much as water does from a fire-plug.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine never could be a specialist, but
must be world-wide in his knowledge, as he is
in his sympathies. Some men are like ponds in
which trout are raised,—small and narrow, serve
a single purpose, and serve it well; but he is
more like the ocean,—broad, and grand, and
manifold in the purposes he serves, and deep as
well. Mr. Blaine is not a shallow man. His
has not been the skimming surface-life of the
swallow, but rather the deep-delving life of reality
and substance. Deep-sea soundings, both of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
men and things, have been a peculiar delight to
him.</p>

<p>Curiosity has ever been a secret spring in him.
He must know all, and he would hunt, and rummage,
and delve, and search, until he did. He has
the scent of a greyhound for evidence, however
abstract, and he would track it down somehow,
“with all the precision of the most deadly
science,” as he did the telegram which Proctor
Knott suppressed. This inborn faculty, which he
has developed to a marvelous degree, has been a
mighty weapon of defence to him, when combinations
and conspiracies have been formed against
him, and of the most cruel character, for his
destruction. For, let it not be forgotten, that
he has lived through that era of American life
when the great effort was to kill off, politically,
the great men of the Republican party. A rebel
congress of Southern brigadiers did their worst,
but the nation applauded as he triumphed.</p>

<p>The same knowledge seems greater power in
him than in ordinary men, or than in almost
any other man, because of his great intellectual
force. Just as a dinner amounts to more in some
men, because of greater power of digestion,—just
as the smooth stone from the brook when in
David’s sling went with greater precision and
power, penetrating the forehead of Goliath. It is
the man and in his combinations, manner, methods,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
and the time, and yet all of these have little
to do with it. Force and directness seem to express
it all. Conventionalities are merely conveniences
to Mr. Blaine, and when not such are
instantly discarded. Common sense is the pilot
of his every voyage. Everything is sacrificed to
this. This, and this alone, has been the crowned
king of his entire career, and all else merely
subjects.</p>

<p>What he has seen in the clear, strong light
of his own best judgment, enlightened by a vast
and varied knowledge, he has seized and sworn
to. He has never plundered others of their cast-iron
rules; he had no use for them. Saul’s armor
never fitted him. He has delighted in the
fathers’ reverences and laws, though but seldom
quotes them. He has no time or taste for such
easy, common methods. He is too original. And
this is one of the strongest features of the man.
He is not simply unlike any other man, but has
no need of resemblance. He has much of the
impetuosity and fiery eloquence of Clay, but
then he has more of the solid grandeur of
Webster. But then he is too much like himself
to be compared intelligibly with others.</p>

<p>There are great extremes in his nature,—not
necessarily contradictions, yet opposites. He is
one of the most fervid men, and yet one of the
most stoical at times, perfectly cool when others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
are hot and boiling. He never loses his head.
There is never a runaway,—but great coolness
and self-possession when it is needed, and ability
to turn on a full head of steam, when the occasion
requires. Here is the testimony of a scholar
and author:—</p>

<p>“One element in his nature impressed itself
upon my mind in a very emphatic manner, and
that is his coolness and self-possession at the
most exciting periods. I happened to be in his
library in Washington when the balloting was
going on in Cincinnati on that hot day in June,
1876. A telegraph-instrument was on his library
table, and Mr. Sherman, his private secretary, a
deft operator, was manipulating its key. Dispatches
came from dozens of friends, giving the
last votes, which only lacked a few of the nomination;
and everybody predicted the success of
Mr. Blaine on the next ballot. Only four persons
besides Mr. Sherman were in the room. It
was a moment of great excitement. The next
vote was quietly ticked over the wire, and then
the next announced the nomination of Mr. Hayes.
Mr. Blaine was the only cool person in the apartment.
It was such a reversal of all anticipations
and assurances, that self-possession was out of the
question except with Mr. Blaine.</p>

<p>“He had just left his bed after two days of
unconsciousness from sunstroke, but he was as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
self-possessed as the portraits upon the walls.
He merely gave a murmur of surprise, and, before
anybody had recovered from the shock, he
had written, in his firm, plain, fluent hand, three
dispatches, now in my possession: one to Mr.
Hayes, of congratulation; one to the Maine delegates,
thanking them for their devotion; and
another to Eugene Hale and Mr. Frye, asking
them to go personally to Columbus and present
his good-will to Mr. Hayes, with promises of
hearty aid in the campaign. The occasion affected
him no more than the news of a servant
quitting his employ would have done. Half an
hour afterward he was out with Secretary Fish
in an open carriage, receiving the cheers of
the thousands of people who were gathered about
the telegraph-bulletins.”</p>

<p>This power of self-control seems to be supreme.
It is just the particular in which so many of
our great men, and small ones too, have miserably
failed. This enables him to harness all his
powers and hold well the reins,—to bring all his
forces into action when emergency requires, and
send solid shot, shrapnel, or shell, with a cool
head and determined hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine has a great memory. Nearly
all who know him will speak of this. He
seems never to forget faces, facts, or figures.</p>

<p>Thirty years after he attended school in Lancaster,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
Ohio, he went there to speak. It was,
of course, known that he was coming, and an
old acquaintance of the town, whom he had not
seen all these years, said, “Now I am going
to station myself up there by the cars, and see
if he will know me. They say he has such a
wonderful memory.” Several were looking on,
watching the operation. Mr. Blaine had no
sooner stepped off from the train than he spied
him, and sang out at once, “Hello, John, how
are you!” and a murmur of surprise went up
from those who were in the secret.</p>

<p>At another time he was near Wheeling,—my
informant thought it was across the river from
Wheeling,—in Belmont County; he met a man
and called him by name. The man said, “Well,
I don’t know you.” Mr. Blaine told him just
where he met him, at a convention, and then
the man could not remember. That night he
told some of his friends about it, and they said
it was a fact; they were with him, and saw
him introduced to Mr. Blaine and talk with
him, and not till then did the man remember
him.</p>

<p>As General Connor, ex-governor of Maine,
who appointed Mr. Blaine to the United States
senate, said: “He could do a thing now as well
as any other time.”</p>

<p>“Governor Connor was in Washington,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
went on to relate, “and called upon Mr. Blaine
when he was secretary of state, and he said, in
his familiar way, ‘Now you talk with Mrs.
Blaine awhile,’ and went into his study. In
about an hour he called him, and all about his
table were lying sheets of paper on which he
had just written. It was his official document
on the Panama canal, and which he read to the
governor. It had been produced during the past
hour, and appeared in print, with scarcely a
change. It came out in a white heat, but it
was all in there ready to be produced at any
time.”</p>

<p>The General remarked, “This one characteristic
of the man, and an element of his popularity
and hold on others, is this close confidence
he exercises in his friends, of which the
above is an illustration.”</p>

<p>And this touches at once another feature, and
that is his ability to read character, and so to
know whom to trust. He goes right into a man’s
life, when he gets at him.</p>

<p>While out riding, during the preparation of
his volume, with his wife, two or three miles
from Augusta, in Manchester township, he got
out to walk, and finding a farmer in a field
near by, he stopped, talked with him some time,
asked him about his history, his ancestors, and
found out pretty much all the man knew about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
himself, and could have told whether it would
do to leave his pocket-book with the man or
no. Such a thing is a habit with him, and
keeps him near the people, gives him a look
into their minds, a peep into their hearts,
as well as a view of their history.</p>

<p>Character-readers usually are persons of strong
intuitions. They see not so much the flesh and
blood of the individual, as the soul within. Just
giving one sharp, quick, penetrating look at the
man in the concrete, and the abstract question
is settled; the man is rated; his value written
down. It is not so much a study as a look,—thought
touches thought, mind feels of mind. It
is power to know clearly, quickly, strongly, and
certainly, with him. He does not have to eat a
whole ham to find out whether it is tainted,
nor drink an entire pan of milk to find out
whether it is sweet.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine is very obliging, and he can usually
tell an opportunity from a chance. Life is
no lottery to him; he keeps his feet on the
granite, and gives all “fortuitous combination of
atoms” the slip, being too discriminating to invest.
One day he was in the old <i>Journal</i> office,
now owned by Sprague and Son,—a very kind and
considerate firm, who are producing a sprightly
daily,—when a citizen entered who had just been
appointed clerk of the Probate Court, and asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
the gentleman to go on his bond. Mr. Blaine
spoke up at once, “I will do it,” and then said
it reminded him of a story, which he proceeded
to tell:—</p>

<p>“Governor Coney lived in Penobscot, shire-town
of Penobscot County, and was judge of
the Probate Court. The sheriff of the County
had failed, and Mr. Sewall, a citizen, met Judge
Coney and said, ‘The sheriff has failed, and
you and I are on his bond.’ ‘Well, that’s good,’
said the judge, ‘I guess you can fix it up.’ ‘O,
but my name is on the left-hand side, as a
witness to his signature.’ So the unlucky judge
was left to contemplate the delightful privilege
of paying what amounted to a rogue’s bail.”</p>

<p>This same clerk of the Probate Court of former
years, but still a friend and neighbor, a
man, however, with an unhappy physical disability,
came upon the lawn when the large
committee to notify him of his nomination were
gathered there to perform that duty, and as the
man told me, Mr. Blaine caught sight of him
off some distance, and “notwithstanding all those
men were there, he spoke right up in his old,
familiar way, ‘How are you, ——?’”</p>

<p>It shows his genuineness and simplicity. There
is enough to him without putting on any airs.
It could not be otherwise than that a nature so
highly wrought and intense, should be possessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
of the powers of withering scorn and just rebuke,
and when the occasion required, could use
them. There happened such an occasion in
1868.</p>

<p>General Grant had been invited to attend the
opening of the European and North American
Railway, at Vanceboro’, in the State of Maine. It
formed a new connecting-link with the British
Provinces. There was a special train of invited
guests, and as General Grant was then president,
and had never been in the state before, it was
quite an honor to be of the company. Mr.
Blaine was, of course, of the number, as were
the leading citizens without respect to party.
A newspaper-correspondent, without any invitation,
got aboard the train, and went with the
party, and on his return reported that President
Grant was drunk. This cut Mr. Blaine to the
quick, because of its untruthfulness, and as he
was a Republican president, and politics usually
ran high in Maine during the palmy days, from
1861 to 1881, when Mr. Blaine was at the helm,
and also because the president was guest of the
state. Not long after, he met the reporter in
the office of Howard Owen, a journalist of Augusta.</p>

<p>“And if you ever saw a man scalped,”—I
use the exact language,—“and the grave-clothes
put on him, and he put in his coffin, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
buried, and the rubbish of the temple thrown
on him forty feet deep, he was the man. I
never heard anything like it in all my born
days: philippics, invectives, satires, these common
things were nowhere.”</p>

<p>“Well, what did he say?”</p>

<p>“What didn’t he say?” was the reply,—“‘You
were not invited, you were simply tolerated;
you sneaked aboard, and then came back here
and lied about us,’ etc.”</p>

<p>But sixteen years had effaced much, and yet
the impression was vivid, as the man’s very expressive
manner betokened.</p>

<p>And a leading Washington correspondent, conversant
with all the sights at the capital, says,
“It would look strange to see him with the
whiskey-drinking crowd at either bar in the capitol
building. He does not visit them, and he
does not drink.”</p>

<p>The great-heartedness of Mr. Blaine comes out
in his book, “Twenty Years in Congress,” and
shows how large are his sympathies. He devotes
over fifteen pages of that great work to
an historical vindication of Brig. Gen. Charles P.
Stone, who was the victim chosen to atone for
the Ball’s Bluff disaster, in which Col. E. D.
Baker, of California, a most gallant officer, lost
his life. It is a deeply interesting portion of the
seventeenth chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>Mr. Blaine is a great lover of fair play. He
is too great to cherish any feeling of resentment,
for he is true-hearted as well as great-hearted.</p>

<p>In this same chapter he presents Mr. Roscoe
Conkling very handsomely, and does him the
honor to quote more extensively from his speech
than from Chandler, Lovejoy, Crittenden, Richardson,
or Thad. Stevens, although Conkling was
younger than any of them. The Republican
party is like a great family to him, and he loves
and cares for all, in the sense of valuing them
highly for their principles’ and works’ sake, and
so studies the things that make for peace,—but
not peace for peace’ sake, but for the sake of
principle.</p>

<p>He asks no quarter for himself, but will follow
out the behests of his great nature in the
interests of others, and the great cause through
which his life has run, like a thread of purest
gold. It is his great friendliness which has enabled
him to take others into his very life, and
live and toil for them so largely. He seems
ever living outside of self,—going outside of self
and entering into their cause and condition, and
making their case his own. He aims to know
enough about those within his reach so that he
shall be interested in them, and can think and
feel intelligently regarding them. His whole nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>
acts in unison, just as heaven designed.
His mind must know, and his heart must love,
and his will must act, while conscience detects
and demands purity of motive.</p>

<p>This honor makes life a joy, a melody, a delight,
and so resonant with constant notes of
praise. He cannot be idle; this is against his
nature; and to be vicious would give him pain.
He is not mean, or low and truckling, but
large and open as the day.</p>

<p>An old Democrat, who had known him ever
since he landed in Augusta, said, when asked a
point-blank question about him as a man, “He
is a good neighbor and a great citizen,” and
this man had had many dealings with him, but
he could not escape the impressions of his work.
No man, it would seem, could stand a better
examination among his neighbors. If a court of
inquiry were established, covering these points,
right where he is best known, it would not be
necessary for him to challenge a juryman, or impeach
a witness.</p>

<p>This same old Democrat said, “A number of
years ago we wanted to fix up the Baptist
church, and they asked me to go and see Mr.
Blaine, as they were making a general call upon
the public. It was on the eve of his departure
for California, but he gave his check at once
for a hundred dollars, and said, ‘If that is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
enough I will give you more when I return.’”
He is interested in all good enterprises, and
turns none empty away. As an instance of the
humanity of the man, a neighbor related the
following:—</p>

<p>“A laborer fell in a fit right out there in the
road near Mr. Blaine’s house, and his sympathies
were all roused for the man. He helped him
what he could, and as he came out of it right
away, Mr. Blaine called to his coachman, and
said, ‘Fred, harness the horse, and take this
man to Hallowell,’ which was ten miles away;
and Mr. Blaine helped the man into his carriage,
in his kindly way, and so sent him home.” He
has time for all these occasions to help and
cheer a fellow-man.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Blaine is just like him. Since their
return from Washington, and since the nomination,
she was returning from a ride, and when near the
gate, there was a crowd. A circus was in town,
and a girl had been run over and badly hurt.
Mrs. Blaine did not begin to scold and blame the
girl for being out in the crowd, but said, “Take
her right into my parlor,” and they did, when
she sent for a doctor, and had every care taken
of the child. She has a mother’s heart, and a
mind suited for the best companionships.</p>

<p>There has been a reference elsewhere to Mr.
Blaine’s marked liberality as a distinguishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>
characteristic. He is not a wealthy man, as
wealth is reckoned to-day, but whenever he has
turned his great abilities to financial matters for
the purpose of money-getting, he has succeeded,
showing most conclusively that, had he served
himself all these years instead of serving the
nation, he would be worth reputed millions. As
it is, he told a friend who asked him, about a
year ago, if reports were true that he was
worth several millions, as people were saying,
and his answer was, “No, I am worth less
than half a million.”</p>

<p>His great activity is very noticeable, especially
in society. He has been compared to Mr. Burlingame
in his ability to see and converse with
three or four persons, while another is seeing
but one. He moves rapidly at times, but with
great care, especially in examining any document
or letter requiring his signature.</p>

<p>He will sign nothing unless it be a common
letter prepared by his private secretary, without
reading every word. But out among men his
activity is quick and constant. He is always in
motion, not in an aimless, nervous way, but in
a wide-awake, fully alive manner. His battery is
ever charged with the freshest and purest electricity.
It would be a thing incredible to find
him asleep in the day-time.</p>

<p>He had a singular habit when editor, of folding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
up little slips of paper and inserting them
between his teeth quickly, or tearing them off
from a newspaper, inserting them, and then
throwing them away, so that after a few moments’
conversation, he would be surrounded with bits of
paper which he had torn off and used in this way.</p>

<p>Long walks have been his habit, and at times
he would strike off across the fields and jump
the fences. “What,” I said to my informant,
“jump the fences?” “Yes,” he said, and another
party confirmed it. To go across lots, they say,
is “the Yankee of it.”</p>

<p>This vigorous exercise is a part of his programme
for keeping up his health. He has had
a cross-bar also, for athletic sports, and made
use of it, too. Life is never dull and monotonous
with him, but always full to the brim.</p>

<p>It is this active, energetic spirit which took
him to England, and for four or five months
all over the continent of Europe; and in 1875
to California, and up and down the Pacific coast;
and it was this same mighty energy of being,
which led him to make five speeches a day
sometimes when he was campaigning in Ohio.
He did this one day, when the last one was to
an immense assemblage in Columbus. And he
generally spoke until he was quite satisfied that
he had the people with him, and they were certain
to vote about right when the time came.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>
His resources of strength, at times, seems
amazing. Many who have known him for thirty
years, speak of his great energy, of his decision
of character, of his power with an audience.</p>

<p>His private secretary, who has been by his
side for fifteen years, says that all the time he
was speaker in congress, he was never late a
single moment, that just exactly at twelve
o’clock, the usual time for meeting, his gavel
would fall, and the House be called to order.</p>

<p>It is a consciousness of responsibility, and
conscientiousness in the discharge of duty, great
readiness for the work, and eagerness to perform
it, that have made him prompt, energetic, accurate,
and determined.</p>

<p>He has been among the broadest of men in
his thinking, reading, observation, experience,
travel, sympathy, purpose, motive, and activities.
Truly his life has been onward and upward,
and with these as his principal characteristics
he has been tested as few men are tested, and
not found wanting. In ten great departments,—as
student, teacher, editor, stump-speaker, legislator,
speaker of the House at home, congressman,
speaker of the National House of Representatives,
United States senator, and secretary
of state,—has he been tried, and not found
wanting. Only a man of transcendent abilities
could have triumphed in such a career.</p>

<small>NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT.</small></h2>
</div>
<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dcm.jpg" width="75" height="76" alt="M">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">M</span>R. BLAINE’S steady march upward
in the line of promotion, was constant
and irresistible, from 1856 to 1876,
and even that year was crowned with
a seat in the United States senate. But the
presidency seemed within his grasp. It was the
demand and expectation of the people that he
should have it. The popular fervor was intense.
He was the ideal statesman of the multitude.
But the cast-iron political machinery, then running
so deftly and with such precision in several
states, was manipulated with a craftiness so
subtle as to defeat their strongly expressed and
urgent wish. They were ready, hat in hand, in
every state and territory in the Union, to cheer
his nomination, when the intelligence came that
the “dark horse,” Rutherford B. Hayes, was the
honored man. No one was more loyal to him
than Mr. Blaine.</p>

<p>The state machinery was run by a Corliss
engine in 1880,—band, pulley, and cog united<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>
the complicated and ingenious device into a
single and powerful combination of great effectiveness.
The whirl of its great wheel, and the
whir of the wheels within, were swift and precise
in their momentum. There was no cessation
of control, no deviation in rate of speed
or execution. The result was ever the same.
The steam-gauge registered three hundred and
six, simply that and nothing more. They would
“make or break,” and so they broke;—Garfield,
grand, and splendid, and worthy, came to be
the convention’s man. And the people loved
him and were loyal to him,—none more so than
Mr. Blaine.</p>

<p>For the third time the people sent their
chosen men to take for them the great initiative,
that they might have the long-sought privilege
of endorsing him with their suffrage. It was a
great day in Chicago,—that Tuesday, the third
of June, 1884,—when the great convention opened
in the massive exposition building, where four years
before the stubborn contest was had. Fresh
men were there. The old machinery was worn
out, broken, and cast aside,—not a squeak of
it was heard. New men were at the helm
when Senator Sabin, of Minnesota, chairman of
the Republican National Committee, called the
convention to order.</p>

<p>After prayer, and the reading of the call for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>
the convention, Senator Sabin addressed the convention,
welcoming them to Chicago, as amongst
the most cherished spots in our country, sacred
to the memories of a Republican. “It was the
birthplace of Republican victories. Here the
fathers chose that immortal chief who first led
us on to victory,—Abraham Lincoln; here they
elevated to the first place in the nation that
great chieftain of the conflict,—General Grant;
here they nominated that honored soldier, that
shining citizen, that representative American,—James
A. Garfield.”</p>

<p>Hon. John R. Lynch, of Mississippi, a colored
gentleman, well known throughout the South for
his conspicuous parliamentary ability, for his
courage, and for his character, was chosen temporary
chairman.</p>

<p>The following day, after prayer, memorials and
resolutions were presented in great profusion,
which were referred to committees, save one,
and that was, “that all are bound to support
the nominee of the convention,” which, after a
determined discussion, pro and con., was withdrawn.</p>

<p>Gen. John B. Henderson, of St. Louis, was
made permanent chairman.</p>

<p>Thursday, June 5th, the nominations began.
When in the call of states Maine was reached,
the vast assembly arose, and for nearly six or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>
eight minutes, twelve to fourteen thousand people
were shouting at the top of their voices,
cheer upon cheer, and could not be restrained.
Then Judge West, of Ohio, in a speech from the
people’s heart, presented, amid almost continuous
applause, the name of the people’s choice,—James
G. Blaine. The names of Generals Hawley
and John A. Logan had been presented.</p>

<p>When Hon. T. C. Platt, of New York, seconded
the nomination of Mr. Blaine, the applause broke
out anew at the mention of the magic name,
more tumultuous than before. It was a nation
in miniature, sending forth the sovereignty of
their hearts, not to be baffled a third time, but
surely to win.</p>

<p>Governor Davis of Maine, Goodeloe of Kentucky,
and Galusha A. Grow of Pennsylvania,
joined in most exalting kind of commendations,
in seconding the nomination, while flags were
waved, and every conceivable form of demonstration
consistent with the hour, was indulged in.</p>

<p>Mr. Townsend placed President Arthur in
nomination, seconded by Bingham of Pennsylvania,
Lynch of Mississippi, Winston of North
Carolina, and Pinchback of Louisiana.</p>

<p>Judge Foraker, of Ohio, presented the name
of John Sherman. Judge Holt, of Kentucky,
seconded Mr. Sherman’s nomination, and Ex-Governor
Long, of Massachusetts, seconded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>
George William Curtis, of New York, presented
the name of Senator Edmunds, of Vermont.</p>

<p>Friday, June 6th, after the usual prayer and
preliminary exercises, the voting began. On the
first ballot Mr. Blaine had three hundred and thirty-four
and one-half; Arthur, two hundred and
seventy-eight; Edmunds, ninety-three; Logan, sixty-three
and one-half; John Sherman, thirty;
Hawley, thirteen; Lincoln, four; and W. T.
Sherman, two.</p>

<p>The second ballot resulted in three hundred
and forty-nine for Blaine; two hundred and seventy-six
for Arthur; eighty-five for Edmunds;
sixty-one for Logan; twenty-eight for John Sherman;
thirteen for Hawley; four for Lincoln; two
for W. T. Sherman.</p>

<p>Cheering followed the announcement of gains
for Blaine. With many incidents the third ballot
was taken, increasing Mr. Blaine’s ballot
twenty-six votes, to three hundred and seventy-five;
Arthur went down to two hundred and
seventy-four; Edmunds, sixty-nine; John Sherman,
twenty-five; Logan, fifty-three; Hawley,
thirteen; Lincoln, seven; and W. T. Sherman,
one.</p>

<p>Cheers again rent the air, and confusion ensued;
the inevitable was in sight, and motions
to adjourn, and in various ways to postpone the
result, were resorted to; but Stewart, of Blaine’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span>
native state, said, “We are ready for the brunt
of battle, Mr. Chairman; let it come.” And
come it did, though filibustering abounded to
prevent it.</p>

<p>In the midst of the fourth and decisive ballot,
General Logan’s despatch came, to cast his
strength for Blaine.</p>

<p>Senator Shelby M. Cullom, of Illinois, began
the stampede by announcing thirty-four votes
from Illinois for Blaine, seven for Logan, and
three for Arthur.</p>

<p>Judge Foraker, of Ohio, followed, and withdrawing
John Sherman, cast forty-six votes for
James G. Blaine, amid a tremendous outburst of
applause.</p>

<p>A whirlwind of vociferous cheering, unmanageable
and unparalleled, greeted the announcement:
Blaine five hundred and forty-one; Arthur still
had two hundred and seven; Edmunds, forty-one;
Hawley, fifteen; Logan, seven, and Lincoln,
two.</p>

<p>But Blaine was nominated, after contesting for
eight years, in three of the greatest conventions
ever held, with the principal men of the nation.
The nomination was made unanimous, in the
midst of the wildest enthusiasm.</p>

<p>At the evening session, Senator Plumb of
Kansas, seconded by Judge Houck of Tennessee,
Thurston of Nebraska, Lee of Pennsylvania,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>
and Congressman Horr of Michigan, nominated
John A. Logan for vice-president.</p>

<p>Gen. J. S. Robinson, in seconding the nomination
of General Logan, moved to suspend the
rules and nominate him by acclamation, which
was carried.</p>

<p>Logan’s total vote was seven hundred and
seventy-nine, the New York delegation having
given six votes for Gresham, and one for Judge
Foraker.</p>

<p>The voice of the people had at last been
heard, and the men of their choice presented as
the standard-bearers, and from East to West
went up a shout of joy, which had in it the
ring of a long-cherished purpose to see that
the “calling and election” of their heroes should
“be made sure” at the polls.</p>

<small>JOHN A. LOGAN.</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dci.jpg" width="77" height="75" alt="I">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>T was on the 9th of February, 1826,
that John A. Logan was born, at
Murphysborough, Ill., a little town
among the hills that hem in the
Mississippi River. He was the eldest of eleven
children.</p>

<p>His father was a physician, and came to
America from Ireland three years before, while
his mother, Elizabeth Jenkins, was from a family
that lived in Tennessee.</p>

<p>He grew up, strong and powerful in youth,
amid the exciting scenes of purely western life.
It was a life that appealed to courage, placed
a premium upon all of manly energy and exertion,
and infused into him, with every breath,
that best of robust health which, like bank-stock
drawing a high rate of interest, has met
every demand made upon it for over half a
century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span>His advantages of education in early youth
were of a slender character, except as he
derived instruction from the teaching of his
father and at his mother’s knee; for no regular
schools existed in the settlement, except
at a log school-house, where an itinerant teacher
presided, under whose tuition only the quickest
and aptest boy or girl would make advancement.</p>

<p>One who knows him well says that when eighteen
years old he was sent to the nearest
school, called Shiloh Academy, under the jurisdiction
of the Methodist Church, and graduated
from it into the Mexican war. He had breathed
an atmosphere of war from childhood. In his
youth the stories of the war of 1812 and of
the Revolution were fresh in the memories and
constantly in the mouths of those about him,
many of whom had been actual participants.
The Seminole and Black-Hawk wars had occurred
in his youth, and personal acquaintance
with many who had participated in them kindled
in him the glow and fervor of adventure. He
enlisted in the First Illinois Regiment, and went
to Mexico.</p>

<p>Though among the youngest of the men, he
came at once into prominence by his energy
and bearing, and the quick activity of his mind,
and the great fearlessness with which he occupied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
and held each post of danger to which he
was assigned.</p>

<p>There was about him such an utter abandonment
to the work of battle, that his strong
marks of leadership were quickly recognized,
and he was made lieutenant, then adjutant, and
finally quartermaster, a position of grave responsibility
in the enemy’s country.</p>

<p>After the war he studies at college, and then
reads law with his uncle, Alexander M. Jenkins,
who was a great man in southern Illinois. He
had at one time been lieutenant-governor of the
state, and was a Jacksonian Democrat.</p>

<p>In 1849 Mr. Logan was elected clerk of
Jackson County, and continued his study of law.
He took a course of law-lectures at Louisville,
and was admitted to the bar. He commenced
practice with his uncle, and soon gained prominence.
But political life, for one so active,
filled with an unbounded energy, had charms for
him.</p>

<p>Soon after his return from Louisville, he was
elected prosecuting attorney for Jackson County,
in 1852, and the same year to the legislature,
and re-elected in 1853, 1856, and 1857. In 1854
he was elected prosecuting attorney of the third
judiciary district of Illinois, and in 1856 was a
presidential elector on the Buchanan and Breckenridge
ticket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>It was at this time he began his career as
a stump-speaker, and his speeches were regarded
as remarkable examples of eloquence, giving him
a reputation that sent him to congress in 1858.
He was an earnest Douglas man, and being re-nominated
in 1860, he stumped the state with
great success, and was re-elected by a large
majority. This was a transition period. The
great contest was coming on, and “the piping
times of peace” were angry with the most
dread forebodings.</p>

<p>At this point we will let one speak who
knows him well:—</p>

<p>“Right here came a critical period in his
career, and although there are men who still
assert that his sympathy was with the secessionists,
there is plenty of evidence that the
South had no claim upon him,—that whatever
his original sentiments may have been, his public
utterances were always loyal, and that when
the crisis came he was on the right side. The
country he lived in was full of Southern sympathizers,
his mother’s family were secessionists,
and his surroundings made loyalty unpopular.
The story that he tendered his services to Jefferson
Davis is contradicted by that gentleman,
who says he never heard of Logan until more
than a year after the war began.</p>

<p>“There are several witnesses to the fact that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span>
in November, 1860, when Lincoln’s election was
assured, and threats were freely made that he
should not be inaugurated, Logan publicly declared
that he would shoulder a musket and
escort the ‘Rail-Splitter’ to the White House.</p>

<p>“While he was in Washington, attending the
called session of congress in the summer of
1861, he went to the front, as many representatives
did, to visit the army in Virginia, and
being the guest of Colonel Richardson when the
battle of Bull Run took place, he was given a
musket and fought through that eventful July
day as a private in the ranks.”</p>

<p>When congress adjourned in August, he went
home, resigned his seat in congress, raised the
Thirty-first Illinois Regiment, was commissioned
its colonel, and led them into battle at Belmont,
Missouri, ten months after they were mustered
into service. One has well said, “Logan was developed
by the war. The bugler of the army
sounded the key-note of his character, and in an
atmosphere of dust and powder he grew great.”</p>

<p>In that first battle at Belmont he had his
horse shot under him, while leading a successful
bayonet-charge. He fought with General Grant
at Fort Henry, and in the siege and terrific contest
at Fort Donelson he bore a brave, conspicuous
part, and was wounded in the left arm.
He was off duty for a while, and refused a re-election<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span>
to congress, but reported on March 5th
to General Grant for duty at Pittsburgh Landing,
only about a month after the Fort Donelson
engagement, and was at once made a brigadier-general.</p>

<p>Nashville had fallen. Tennessee was largely
within the Union lines, and entrance was being
effected into Georgia and Mississippi; hence the
stubborn resistance of the foe at Pittsburgh Landing.
But victory brought them to the siege of
Corinth, Island No. 10 falling under the guns of
Commodore Foote. Grant and Logan led their
armies down to Vicksburg.</p>

<p>During the winter-campaign in Mississippi and
the siege of Vicksburg, Logan’s bravery was proverbial.
He was given command of a division in
McPherson’s corps, and made a major-general in
the army, within a year of entrance.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1862 he was repeatedly
urged to “run for congress,” but his reply was
worthy a hero: “I have entered the field to die,
if need be, for this Government, and never expect
to return to peaceful pursuits until the object
of this war of preservation has become a
fact established.”</p>

<p>His personal bravery and military skill were
so conspicuous in Grant’s Northern Mississippi
movements, where he commanded a division of
the Seventeenth Army Corps, under General McPherson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span>
he was promoted to the rank of major-general
Nov. 26, 1862. He was present in every
fight, his daring bravery animating his men at
Fort Gibson, Raymond, Jackson, Champion Hill,
and Vicksburg. He was in command of McPherson’s
centre, June 25th, when the assault upon
Vicksburg was made. His column led the entrance
into the city, and he became its first military
governor.</p>

<p>In November, 1863, he was called to succeed
General Sherman in command of his famous
Fifteenth Army Corps. The following May he
joined Sherman as the Georgia campaign was
opening. It was Logan who led the advance of
the Army of the Tennessee at Resaca, who
whipped Hardee’s trained veterans at Dallas, and
drove the enemy from Kenesaw Mountain.</p>

<p>On July 22d he was in the fierce assault before
Atlanta. In this desperate attack upon
Hood, Logan fought as he never fought before,
and when McPherson fell he took command of
the Army of the Tennessee, and with resistless
fury avenged the death of the beloved commander.</p>

<p>After the fall of Atlanta he returned to Illinois,
temporarily, to take part in the presidential
campaign. It was our privilege to hear him then,
and never, it would seem, did such withering
scorn, such utter denunciation, such infinite contempt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span>
show themselves, as he manifested in a
great speech, full of vim and fire, not for the
brave, honest rebel in arms, but for the cowardly
copperheads in the rear.</p>

<p>He was less than forty years of age, only
thirty-eight, but his name and fame as a soldier
were a tower of strength, and he drew together
immense crowds.</p>

<p>Soon after Mr. Lincoln’s second election he
returns to the front, and joins Sherman in his
march to the sea, and continued with him until
the surrender of Gen. Joseph Johnston, on April
26, 1865. After the surrender he marched his
men to Alexandria, and rode at their head in
the grand review in Washington. He had taken
command of the Army of the Tennessee, Oct.
23, 1864, and tendered his resignation when active
service was over, being unwilling to draw
pay unless on duty in the field.</p>

<p>President Johnson tendered him the mission to
Mexico, but he declined it, and returning home
was elected successively to the fortieth, the
forty-first, and the forty-second congresses. He
was selected as one of a committee of seven
to represent the House in the impeachment trial
of Andrew Johnson.</p>

<p>Before he had taken his seat in the forty-second
congress, the legislature of Illinois elected
him to the United States senate for the full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span>
term from March 4, 1871, to succeed the Hon.
Richard Yates, the gallant war-governor of that
state. He was again chosen for the senate, and
took his seat the second time March 18, 1879.
His present term expires March 3, 1885. He
led the delegation of his state in the national
convention of 1880, and was one of the most
determined of the “three hundred and six” who
followed the fortunes of “the old commander,”
General Grant.</p>

<p>He has been an active man at military reunions,
and was one of the founders of the Grand
Army of the Republic. He was the first national
commander of that organization, and as
such issued the order in 1868 for the decoration
of the graves of Union soldiers.</p>

<p>His financial views have been the subject of
criticism, but they have generally represented the
sentiments of his constituency. In 1866 he took
strong grounds in favor of the payment of the
national debt in gold coin. In 1874 he followed
the popular Western movement, and voted for
the Inflation bill, which President Grant vetoed.
But in the following year he favored the Sherman
Resumption act.</p>

<p>General Logan was always a leader in securing
pension legislation. He has been radical in
favoring internal improvements, has always voted
for liberal appropriations for rivers and harbors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span>
and has given his support to railroad land-grant
measures. His property consists of a residence
on Calumet Avenue in Chicago, which is worth
from twenty-five thousand to thirty thousand
dollars, and a farm at his old home in southern
Illinois.</p>

<p>He resides in Washington at a boarding-house
on Twelfth Street, occupying two modest rooms,
the same in which he has lived for twelve
years.</p>

<p>In 1855 he married Miss Mary Cunningham,
of Shawneetown, Ill., and she has proved a
most valuable helpmeet, being as good, if not a
better politician than himself, and a lady of
great refinement as well as intellectual force.
There is no woman in public life who possesses
more admirable traits than Mrs. Logan, and her
popularity with her own sex is quite as great
as with the other. She can write a speech on
finance, or dictate the action of a political caucus,
with as much ease and grace as she can
preside at a dinner-party, or receive her guests.
At the same time she is a devoted mother.
She has two children,—a daughter, who is the
wife of Paymaster Tucker, of the army, and a
son, Manning, a cadet at West Point. Both of
them have been educated by her, or under her
personal supervision.</p>

<p>As a society woman she is graceful and accomplished;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span>
in charities she is always active
and generous; in religion she is a devout
Methodist.</p>

<p>During the campaign of 1866 General Logan
was running for congressman-at-large. The multitudes
came to hear him; a grand stand was
erected in the court-house yard at Bloomington;
thousands were gathered, filling the grounds and
covering the roofs of buildings. He was in his
glory; for three hours he spoke; the people
laughed, and cried, and shouted cheer on cheer.
We had heard Douglas, Lovejoy, Colfax, but
never such a speech as that.</p>

<p>The rebel army was whipped and gone, and
now the Democratic party loomed up as an
enemy in the land.</p>

<p>In telling why he had left the party and become
a staunch Republican, his sarcasm burned
like caustic. He told a story in an inimitable
way, to illustrate the point. It was the story
of the flock of sheep the farmer gave his
boys:—</p>

<p>“Tommy was to divide the flock, and Johnny
take his choice, so Tommy put all the fine, large
ones by themselves, and all the scabby, scaly,
shaggy ones in another yard, and with them
he put Johnny’s little pet lamb, which he had
raised and cared for all summer, feeding it with
fresh, warm milk, and had put a little blue ribbon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span>
with a bell on it, about its neck; and
Tommy knew how he loved it, and so he put
it in with the poor, old, scaly lot of sheep.
When Johnny came to look at the sheep he
looked for Nannie, his lamb; he heard its bell,
and saw it was in bad company, with a miserable
lot of bad sheep, and so he said, ‘Nannie,
good-bye; I’ve loved you. I tied that blue ribbon
about your neck, and put that bell on it.
I’ve fed you and taken care of you all this
time’ (and this description was given with the
most dramatic effect); ‘but, Nannie, we must
part. Johnny, I will take this lot,’ pointing to
all the best sheep.”</p>

<p>The roar was tumultuous when they saw the
point, and it was a terrific hit for the old party,
in with the copperheads and rebels.</p>

<p>It was surely one of the happiest steps of
his life, when he came out on the Republican
side of the Republic’s great battle for the
liberty of the enslaved and the citizenship of
freemen.</p>

<p>Few soldiers are now living, not excepting the
old commander himself, who in a political campaign
will make the heart of the old veterans
beat faster and warmer at the remembrance of
former times, and the achievements of battles
now enjoyed, than Gen. John A. Logan, United
States senator from Illinois, and Republican candidate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[421]</span>
for vice-president, with James G. Blaine,
of Maine, for president.</p>

<p>The old hearts thrill anew, and the old shout
rings out again, and the victory of the past must
at their hands be perpetuated in the victory of
the future.</p>
